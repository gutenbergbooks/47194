<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>In preparing this volume the author has been guided by
his own platform experience extending over twelve years.
During that time he has given hundreds of public recitals
before audiences of almost every description, and in all
parts of the country. It may not be considered presumptuous,
therefore, for him to offer some practical suggestions
on the art of entertaining and holding an audience, and to
indicate certain selections which he has found have in
themselves the elements of success.</p>

<p>The "encore fiend," as he is sometimes called, is so ubiquitous
and insistent that no speaker or reader can afford
to ignore him, and, indeed, must prepare for him in advance.
To find material that will satisfy him in one or in
a dozen of the ordinary books of selections is an almost
impossible task. It is only too obvious that many compilations
of the kind are put together by persons who have
had little or no practical platform experience. In an attempt
to remedy this defect this volume has been prepared.</p>

<p>It is believed that the book will be valuable not only to
the amateur and the professional reader, speaker, elocutionist,
and entertainer, but also to the after-dinner and
impromptu speaker, the politician who wants to make a
"hit," the business man who wishes to tell a good story
and tell it effectively, the school-teacher in arranging her
"Friday Afternoon" programs, as well as for reading
aloud in the family circle, and for many other occasions.</p>

<p>Providing, as this work does, helpful hints on how to hold
an audience, it is hoped that the additional suggestions
offered regarding the use of the voice and its modulation,
the art of pausing, the development of feeling and energy,
the use of gesture and action, the cultivation of the imagination,
the committing of selections to memory, and the standing
before an audience, while not as elaborate and detailed
as found in a regular manual of elocution, will be of practical
benefit to those who can not conveniently command
the services of a personal instructor.</p>

<p>The author has been greatly assisted in this undertaking
not only by the kind permission of publishers and authors
to use their copyrighted work, but also by the hearty cooperation
of many distinguished platform speakers and
readers who have generously contributed successful selections
not hitherto published.</p>

<p>The author gratefully acknowledges the special permission
granted him by the publishers to print the following
copyright selections: "Keep A-goin'!" the Bobbs-Merrill
Company, "A Modern Romance," the Publishers of <i>The
Smart Set</i>; "The Fool's Prayer," Houghton, Mifflin &amp;

<h2><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I"></a>PART I<br />
HOW TO HOLD AN AUDIENCE</h2>


<p>To hold the interest of an audience and to successfully
entertain it&mdash;whether from public platform, in fraternal
organization, by after-dinner speech, or in the home circle&mdash;is
a worthy accomplishment. Moreover, the memorizing
of selections and rendering them before an audience
is one of the best preparations for the larger and more important
work of public speaking. Many of our most successful
after-dinner speakers depend almost entirely upon
their ability to tell a good story.</p>

<p>The art of reciting and story-telling has become so popular
in recent years that a wide-spread demand has arisen
for books of selections and suggestions for rendering them.
Material suitable for encores has been particularly difficult
to find. It is thought, therefore, that the present volume,
containing as it does a great variety of short numbers, will
meet with approval.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no talent that is more entertaining and
more instructive than that of reciting aloud specimens of
prose and poetry, both humorous and serious, from our
best writers. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>Channing says:</p>

<p>"Is there not an amusement, having an affinity with the
drama, which might be usefully introduced among us? I
mean, Recitation.</p>

<p>"A work of genius, recited by a man of fine taste, enthusiasm,
and powers of elocution, is a very pure and high
gratification.</p>

<p>"Were this art cultivated and encouraged, great numbers,
now insensible to the most beautiful compositions,
might be waked up to their excellence and power.</p>

<p>"It is not easy to conceive of a more effectual way of
spreading a refined taste through a community. The drama
undoubtedly appeals more strongly to the passions than
recitation; but the latter brings out the meaning of the
author more. Shakespeare, worthily recited, would be better
understood than on the stage.</p>

<p>"Recitation, sufficiently varied, so as to include pieces
of chaste wit, as well as of pathos, beauty, and sublimity,
is adapted to our present intellectual progress."</p>

<p>To recite well, and to be able to hold an audience, one
should be trained in the proper use of the voice and body
in expression. This requires painstaking study and preparation.
It is a mistake to suppose that much can be safely
left to impulse and the inspiration of the occasion. With
all great artists everything is premeditated, studied, and
rehearsed beforehand.</p>

<p>Salvini, the great Italian tragedian, said to the pupils
in his art: "Above all, study,&mdash;<i>study</i>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">STUDY</span>. All the
genius in the world will not help you along with any art,
unless you become a hard student. It has taken me <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>years
to master a single part."</p>


<h3>THE VOICE</h3>

<p>The voice can be rapidly and even wonderfully developed
by practising for a few minutes daily exercises prescribed
in any good manual of elocution.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Learn to speak
in the natural voice. If it is high-pitched, nasal, thin, or
unmusical, these defects can be overcome by patient and
judicious practise. Do not assume an artificial voice, except
in impersonation. Remember that intelligent audiences
demand intelligent expression, and will not tolerate the
ranting, bombast, and unnatural style of declamation of
former days.</p>

<p>Many people speak with half-shut teeth and mouth. Open
the mouth and throat freely; liberate all the muscles around
the vocal apparatus. Aim to speak with ease, and endeavor
to improve the voice in depth, purity, roundness, and flexibility.
Daily conversation offers the best opportunity for
this practise.</p>

<p>A writer recently said: "Only a very, very few of us
Americans speak English as the English do. We have our
own 'accent,' as it is called. We are a nervous, eager,
strident people. We know it, tho we do not relish having
foreigners tell us about it. We speak not mellowly, not
with lax tongues and palates, but sharply, shrilly, with
hardened mouth and with tones forced back upon the palate.
We strangulate two-thirds of our vowels and swallow half
the other third. Pure, round, sonorous tones are almost
never heard in our daily speech."</p>

<p>Speak from the abdomen. All the effort, all the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>motive
power, should come from the waist and abdominal muscles.
These are made to stand the strain that is so often incorrectly
put upon the muscles of the throat. Aim at a forward
tone; that is, send your voice out to some distant
object, imaginary or otherwise, without unduly elevating
the pitch. The voice should strike against the hard palate,
the hard bony arch just above the upper teeth. Most of
the practising should be done on the low pitches.</p>

<p>If there is any serious physical defect of the throat or
nose, consult a reliable physician.</p>

<p>Do not overtax the voice. Three periods of ten minutes
each are better than an hour's practise at one time. Stop
at the first sign of weariness. Do not practise within an
hour after eating. Avoid the habitual use of lozenges.
There is nothing better for the throat than a gargle of salt
and water, used night and morning. Dash cold water on
the outside of the throat and rub it vigorously with a coarse
towel.</p>

<h3>THE BREATH</h3>

<p>The proper management of the breath is an important
part of good speaking. Some teachers say the air should
be inhaled on all occasions exclusively through the nose.
This is practically impossible while in the act of speaking.
The aim should be to speak on full lungs as much as possible;
therefore a breath must be taken at every opportunity.
This is done during the pauses, but often the time is so short
that the speaker will find it necessary to use both mouth
and nose to get a full supply of air. The breathing should
be inaudible.</p>

<p>Practise deep breathing until it becomes an unconscious
habit. <i>In taking in the breath the abdomen and chest <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>both
expand, and in giving out the breath the abdomen and
chest both contract.</i> By this method of respiration the
abdomen is used as a kind of "bellows," and the strain is
taken entirely off the throat. The breathing should be
done without noticeable effort and without raising the
shoulders. Whenever possible the breathing should be long
and deep. While speaking, endeavor to hold back in the
lungs, or reservoir, the supply of air, "feeding" it very
gradually to the vocal cords in just the quantity required
for a given tone. Reciting aloud, when properly done, is
a healthful exercise, and the voice should grow and improve
through use; but to speak on half-filled lungs, or from the
throat, is distressing and often injurious.</p>

<p>Keep your shoulders well thrown back, head erect, chin
level, arms loosely at the sides, and in walking throw the
leg out from the hip with easy, confident movement. The
weight of the body should be on the ball of the foot, altho
the whole foot touches the floor. The breathing should be
deep, smooth, and deliberate.</p>

<p>When the breath is not being used in speech, breathe exclusively
through the nose. This is particularly desirable
during the hours of sleep. As someone has said, if you
awake at night and find your mouth open, get up and shut
it. A well-known English authority on elocution says that
as a golden rule for the preservation of the health, he considers
the habit of breathing through the nose invaluable
if not imperative. Air, which is the breath of life, has always
floating in it also the seeds of death. The nose is a
filter and deodorizer, in passing through which the air is
cleansed and sent pure into the lungs. The nose warms
the air as well as purifies it, and thus prevents it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span> from
being breathed in that raw, damp state which is so injurious
to those whose lungs are delicate.</p>

<p>Speak immediately upon opening your mouth. Try to
turn into pure-toned voice every particle of breath you
give out. Replenish the lungs every time you pause. Light
gymnastics, brisk walking, running, horseback riding, and
other exercise will improve your breathing capacity.</p>


<h3>MODULATION</h3>

<p>Modulation simply means change of voice. These
changes, however, must be intelligent and appropriate to
the thought. Monotony&mdash;speaking in one tone&mdash;must be
avoided. The speaker should have the ability to raise or
lower the pitch of his voice at will, as well as to vary it in
force, intensity, inflection, etc.</p>

<p>Do not confuse "pitch" with "force." Pitch refers to
the <i>key</i> of the speaking voice, while force relates to the
<i>loudness</i> of the voice. The movement or rate of speaking
should be varied to suit the particular thought. It would
be ridiculous to describe a horse-race in the slow, measured
tones of a funeral procession.</p>

<p>Most of your speaking should be done in the middle and
lower registers; but the higher pitches, altho not so often
required, must be trained so as to be ready for use. These
higher tones are frequently thin and unmusical, but they
can be made full and firm through practise.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to study many rules for inflection.
The speaker should know in a general way that when the
sense is suspended the voice follows this tendency and runs
up, and when the sense is completed the voice runs down.
In other words, the voice should simply be in agreement
with the tendency of the thought, whether it opens up or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
closes down. The lengths of inflection vary according to
the thought and the required emphasis.</p>

<p>For most occasions the speaking should be clear-cut and
deliberate. The larger the room or hall, the slower should
be the speech, to give the vocal vibrations time to travel.
Dwelling on words too long, drawling, or over precision in
articulation, is tedious to an audience. The other extreme,
undue haste, suggests lack of self-control, and is fatal to
successful effort. Of course this does not apply to special
selections demanding rapid speech.</p>

<p>There are numerous words in English that represent or
at least suggest their meaning in their sound. One who
aims to read or recite well should study these effects so as
to use them skilfully and with judgment.</p>

<p>The most complete and concise treatment on the subject
of expression is perhaps that given in <i>Hamlet's</i> advice to
the players when he says:</p>

<p>"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you&mdash;<i>trippingly</i> on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as
many of your players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke
my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand,
thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest,
and as I may say whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire
and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.
O! it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated
fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split
the ears of the groundlings; who, for the most part, are
capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows, and noise.
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;
it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it....</p>

<p>"Be not too tame neither, but let your own <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the
action, with this special observance, that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first, and
now, was, and is, to hold, as 't were, the mirror up to nature;
to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image,
and the very age and body of the time, his form and pressure.
Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, tho it make
the unskilful laugh, can not but make the judicious grieve;
the censure of the which one must, in your allowance,
o'erweigh a whole theater of others. O! there be players,
that I have seen play&mdash;and heard others praise, and that
highly&mdash;not to speak it profanely, that, neither having
the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan,
nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought
some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made
them well, they imitated humanity so abominably."</p>


<h3>PAUSING</h3>

<p>Words naturally divide themselves into groups according
to their meaning. Grammatical pauses indicate the
construction of language, while rhetorical pauses mark
more particularly the natural divisions in the sense. To
jumble words together, or to rattle them off in "rapid-fire"
style, is not an entertaining performance. Proper
pausing secures economy of the listener's attention, and
is as desirable in spoken as in written language.</p>

<p>Pauses should vary in frequency and duration. It
should be remembered that words are only symbols, and
that the speaker should concern himself seriously about
the thought which these symbols represent. The concept
behind the sign is the important thing. The fine art of
pausing can be acquired only after long and faithful study.
Then it may become an unconscious habit. An old rime
on this subject is worth repeating:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"In pausing, ever let this rule take place,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Never to separate words in any case<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That are less separable than those you join;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And, which imports the same, not to combine<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Such words together, as do not relate<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So closely as the words you separate."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>FEELING AND ENERGY</h3>

<p>Before you can properly <i>feel</i> what you say you must
<i>understand</i> it. Artificial and imitative methods do not
produce enduring results. In studying a passage or selection
for recitation, the imagination must be kindled, the
feelings stimulated, and the mind trained to concentrate
upon the thought until it is <i>experienced</i>. This subjective
work should always precede the attempt at objective expression.
Everything must first be conceived, pictured,
and experienced in the mind. When this is done with intelligence,
sincerity, and earnestness, there should be little
difficulty in giving true and adequate expression to thought.</p>

<p>In all speaking that is worth the while there must be
energy, force, and life. The speaker should be wide-awake,
alert, palpitating. A speaker&mdash;and this applies to the reciter
and elocutionist&mdash;should be, as someone has said, "an
animal galvanic battery on two legs."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He must know
what he is about. He must <i>be in east</i>.</p>

<p>Make a distinction between loudness and intensity.
Often the best effects are produced by suggesting power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>in reserve rather than giving the fullest outward expression.
Intensity in reading or reciting is secured chiefly
through concentration and a thorough grasp of the thought.
Endeavor to put yourself into your voice. Do not forget
that deep, concentrated feeling is never loud. Avoid
shouting, ranting, and "tearing a passion to tatters." Go
to nature for models. Ask what one would do in real life
in uttering the thoughts under consideration.</p>

<p>The emotions must be brought under control by frequent
practise. Joy, sorrow, anger, fear, surprize, terror, and
other feelings are as colors to the artist and must be made
ready for instant use. To quote Richard Mansfield:</p>

<p>"When you are enacting a part, think of your voice as
a color, and, as you paint your picture (the character you
are painting, the scene you are portraying), mix your colors.
You have on your palate a white voice, <i>la voix blanche</i>;
a heavenly, ethereal or blue voice, the voice of prayer; a
disagreeable, jealous, or yellow voice; a steel-gray voice,
for quiet sarcasm; a brown voice of hopelessness; a lurid,
red voice of hot rage; a deep, thunderous voice of black;
a cheery voice, the color of the green sea that a brisk breeze
is crisping; and then there is a pretty little pink voice, and
shades of violet&mdash;but the subject is endless."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> See "Before an Audience," by Nathan Sheppard. Published by
Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company. Price, 75 cents.</p></div>


<h3>GESTURE AND ACTION</h3>

<p>No better advice can be given upon this subject than to
"Suit the action to the word; the word to the action."
Unless a gesture in some way helps in the expression and
understanding of a thought, it should be omitted. Gesture
is not a mere ornament, but a natural and necessary
part of true expression. The arms and hands should be
trained to perform their work gracefully, promptly, and
effectively. If too many gestures are used they lose their
force and meaning. Furthermore, too many gestures confuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
and annoy the auditor.</p>

<p>Gesture should be practised, preferably before a looking-glass,
so thoroughly <i>beforehand</i> as to make it an unconscious
act when the speaker comes before his audience.</p>

<p>The correct standing position is to have one foot slightly
in advance of the other. The taller the person, the broader
should be the base or width between the feet. The body
should be erect but not rigid. In repose the arms should
drop naturally at the sides. Except in the act of gesticulating
do not try to put the hands anywhere, and above all,
if a man, not in the pockets.</p>


<h3>IMPERSONATION</h3>

<p>The aim here should be to lose one's self in the part.
To subordinate one's tones, gestures, and manners, and to
live the character for the time being, requires no mean
ability. Impersonation calls for imagination, insight, concentration,
and adaptability. The impersonator must be
all at it, and at it all, during the whole time he is impersonating
the character.</p>

<p>"To fathom the depths of character," said Macready,
the distinguished English actor, "to trace its latent motives,
to feel its finest quiverings of emotion, to comprehend
the thoughts that are hidden under words, and thus
possess one's self of the actual mind of the individual man,
is the highest reach of the player's art, and is an achievement
that I have discerned but in few. Kean&mdash;when under
the impulse of his genius he seemed to <i>clutch</i> the whole
idea of the man&mdash;was an extraordinary instance among
those possessing the faculty of impersonation."</p>

<p>Where dialect is used it should be closely studied from
life. Stage representations of foreign character are not
always trustworthy models.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span></p>


<h3>ARTICULATION AND PRONUNCIATION</h3>

<p>Articulate and pronounce correctly and distinctly without
being pedantic. The organs of articulation&mdash;teeth,
tongue, lips, and palate&mdash;should be trained to rapidly and
accurately repeat various sets of elements, until any combination
of sounds, no matter how difficult, can be uttered
with facility, accuracy, and precision.</p>

<p>A standard dictionary should be consulted whenever
there is a doubt either about the meaning or the pronunciation
of a word. As to the standard of pronunciation,
the speaker should consider at least these three things: (1)
authority, (2) custom, and (3) personal taste.</p>


<p>There are many words commonly mispronounced, but
only a few can be referred to here: Do not say <i>Toos</i>-day or
<i>Chews</i>-day for T<i>u</i>esday; <i>ur</i>-ride for ride; i-<i>ron</i> for i-<i>urn</i>;
w<i>u</i>s for w<i>a</i>s; th<i>u</i>n for th<i>a</i>n; subj<i>i</i>ct for subj<i>e</i>ct; <i>awf</i>-fiss
for <i>off</i>-fiss; fig-<i>ger</i> for fig<i>u</i>re; to-<i>wards</i> for tords; <i>dook</i> for
d<i>u</i>ke; k<i>e</i>tch for c<i>a</i>tch; <i>day</i>-po for <i>de</i>-po; ab'domen for
abdo'men; advertise'ment for adver'tisement; ly'ceum for
lyce'um; oc'cult for occult'; of<i>t</i>en for of'n; s<i>e</i>nce for s<i>i</i>nce;
su<i>j</i>gest for su<i>g</i>gest; <i>wow</i>nd for <i>woo</i>nd; <i>weth</i>er for w<i>h</i>ether;
sen'ile for s<i>e</i>'nile; <i>ad</i>'dress for ad<i>dress</i>'; il'lustrate for illus'trate;
<i>ker</i>-own for crown; wind<i>er</i> for wind<i>ow</i>; s<i>or</i> for
s<i>aw</i>; wick<i>ud</i> for wick<i>ed</i>; <i>i</i>ngine for <i>e</i>ngine; <i>o</i>ntil for <i>u</i>ntil.</p>

<p>Words should drop from the mouth like newly-made coins
from the mint. Practising on words of several syllables
is helpful. Some such as these will serve as examples:
"particularly," "unconstitutional," "incompatibility,"
"unnecessarily," "voluminous," "overwhelmingly," "<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>sesquipedalian,"
etc.</p>


<h3>IMAGINATION</h3>

<p>The ability to make vivid mental pictures of what one
recites is of great value to both reader and hearer. Everyone
has this faculty to some degree, but few develop it as
it should be developed for use in speaking. The clearer
the mental picture the speaker has in mind the more vivid
will it be to the hearer. Practise making mental images
with pictures that appeal strongly to you. Try to see
everything in detail. If at first the impressions are obscure,
persevere in your practise and substantial results
will surely come. Dr. Silas Neff gives a splendid illustration
of this kind that can be effectively used for practise:</p>

<p>"A woodman once lived with his family near a shallow
stream which flowed between high banks and in the middle
of which, opposite his house, was an island. Half a mile
up the stream was a dam which supplied water for a saw-mill
a hundred yards below. One morning after the father
had gone to the mill to work, leaving his wife in the back
yard washing some little garments, their two little boys
clambered down the bank and waded through the water
to the island where they had spent many happy hours in
play. About the middle of the forenoon, from some unknown
cause, the wall of the dam suddenly gave way, the
water plunging through and nearly filling the banks of the
stream. The father in the mill heard the noise and looking
out saw what had happened. Immediately thinking of his
boys he dashed out, hat and coat off, on an awful race down
the creek to save their lives. The water after <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>leaving the
dam flowed rather slowly for some time and he was soon
quite a distance ahead, but he knew that unless he gained
very rapidly here, the descent being much greater farther
down, the water would overtake his boys before he could
reach them. His wife suddenly looked up as the agonizing
cries of her husband fell upon her ear. She rushed to the
front yard. In quick succession she distinguished the
words, 'Get the boys!' The father was a few hundred yards
from his home. The water had reached the rapid part of
the stream but some distance behind the man. The wife
on hearing the words, tho not knowing what was wrong,
jumped down the bank and ran through the water, shrieking
to the boys. Just as she reached the island they ran
to her and, without uttering a word, she took one under
each arm and started back as wildly as she came. When
half way over she saw her husband dashing out from the
edge of the woods and the water not twenty feet behind
him. They met at the top of the bank, the father grasped
wife and children in his arms and the water passed harmlessly
by."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>HOW TO MEMORIZE A SELECTION</h3>


<p>Do not learn a selection simply by rote&mdash;that is, by
repeating it parrot-like over and over again&mdash;but fix it in
the mind by a careful and detailed analysis of the thought.
As you practise aloud, train your eye to take in as many
words as possible, then look away from the book as you
recite them aloud. This will give the memory immediate
practise and will tend to make it self-reliant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>
<p>Having chosen a selection, read it over first in a general
way to secure an impression of it in its entirety. Then read
it a second time, giving particular attention to each part.
Consult a dictionary for the correct meaning and pronunciation
of every word about which you are in doubt. Next
underline the emphatic words&mdash;those which you think best
express the most important thoughts. Underscoring one
line for emphatic words and two lines for the most emphatic
will do for this purpose. Now indicate the various pauses,
both grammatical and rhetorical, by drawing short perpendicular
lines between the words where they occur. In a
general way use one line for a short pause, two lines for a
medium pause, and three lines for a long pause. On the
margin of the selection you may make other notes, such as
the dominant feeling, transitions, changes of rate, force
and pitch, special effects, gestures, facial expression, etc.</p>

<p>There is, of course, nothing arbitrary about this work of
analysis. Its purpose is to make the student <i>think</i>, to analyze,
to be painstaking. The following annotated selection
should be carefully considered. Words on which chief emphasis
is to be placed are printed in small capitals; those on
which less emphasis is to be placed, in italics. It is not intended
to be mechanical, but suggestive. After a few selections
have been analyzed in this way, pausing and emphasis,
and many other elements of expression, will largely take
care of themselves.</p>

<h3>BEFORE THE AUDIENCE</h3>

<p>As you present yourself to your audience, bow slightly
and graciously from the waist. Be courteous, but not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>servile.
Avoid haste and familiarity. Be punctilious in dress
and deportment, and be prompt in keeping your appointments.</p>

<p>Be sure you have everything ready in advance. If you
have to use any properties, such as a table, chair, eye-glass,
books, reading-stand, coat, hat, gloves, letters, etc., see that
everything is provided and in its place before the time set
for your appearance.</p>

<p>Success often depends upon the judicious choice of selections
for the occasion. What will be acceptable to one
audience may not please another. The sentiment and the
length of selections depend upon the time and place where
they are to be given. When an audience expects to be entertained
with humorous rec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>itations, to announce in a
sepulchral voice that you will give them a poem of your
own composition, entitled "The Three Corpses," of melancholy
character, is likely to send a chill of disappointment
through them.</p>

<p>Never keep your audience waiting. If an encore is demanded,
return and bow, or if the demand is insistent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>give another number, preferably a short one. Do not be too
eager to give encores; if the applause is not insistent, a
bow will suffice.</p>

<h3>MELPOMENUS JONES<br />
BY STEPHEN LEACOCK</h3>

<p>Some people find great difficulty in saying good-by when making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
a call or spending the evening. As the moment draws near when
the visitor feels that he is fairly entitled to go away, he rises and
says abruptly, "Well, I think&mdash;&mdash;" Then the people say, "Oh,
must you go now? Surely it's early yet!" and a pitiful struggle
ensues.</p>

<p>I think the saddest case of this kind of thing that I ever knew
was that of my poor friend Melpomenus Jones, a curate&mdash;such
a dear young man and only twenty-three! He simply couldn't get
away from people. He was too modest to tell a lie, and too religious
to wish to appear rude. Now it happened that he went to
call on some friends of his on the very first afternoon of his summer
vacation. The next six weeks were entirely his own&mdash;absolutely
nothing to do. He chatted a while, drank two cups of tea,
then braced himself for the effort and said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Well, I think I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the lady of the house said, "Oh, no, Mr. Jones, can't you
really stay a little longer?"</p>

<p>Jones was always truthful&mdash;"Oh, yes, of course, I&mdash;er&mdash;can."</p>

<p>"Then please don't go."</p>

<p>He stayed. He drank eleven cups of tea. Night was falling.
He rose again.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I think I really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must go? I thought perhaps you could have stayed to
dinner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, so I could, you know, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then please stay; I'm sure my husband will be delighted."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll stay"; and he sank back into his chair, just
full of tea, and miserable.</p>

<p>Father came home. They had dinner. All through the meal
Jones sat planning to leave at eight-thirty. All the family wondered
whether Mr. Jones was stupid and sulky, or only stupid.</p>

<p>After dinner mother undertook to "draw him out" and showed
him photographs. She showed him all the family museum, several
gross of them&mdash;photos of father's uncle and his wife, and
mother's brother and his little boy, and awfully interesting photos
of father's uncle's friend in his Bengal uniform, an awfully well-taken
photo of father's grandfather's partner's dog, and an
awfully wicked one of father as the devil for a fancy-dress ball.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty Jones had examined seventy-one photographs.
There were about sixty-nine more that he hadn't. Jones rose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>
<p>"I must say good-night now," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"Say good-night! why it's only half-past eight! Have you
anything to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he admitted, and muttered something about staying
six weeks, and then laughed miserably.</p>

<p>Just then it turned out that the favorite child of the family,
such a dear little romp, had hidden Mr. Jones' hat; so father
said that he <i>must</i> stay, and invited him to a pipe and a chat.
Father had the pipe and gave Jones the chat, and still he stayed.
Every moment he meant to take the plunge, but couldn't. Then
father began to get very tired of Jones, and fidgeted and finally
said, with jocular irony, that Jones had better stay all night&mdash;they
could give him a shake-down. Jones mistook his meaning
and thanked him with tears in his eyes, and father put Jones to
bed in the spare-room and curst him heartily.</p>

<p>After breakfast next day, father went off to his work in the
city and left Jones playing with the baby, broken-hearted. His
nerve was utterly gone. He was meaning to leave all day, but
the thing had got on his mind and he simply couldn't. When
father came home in the evening he was surprized and chagrined
to find Jones still there. He thought to jockey him out with a
jest, and said he thought he'd have to charge him for his board,
he! he! The unhappy young man stared wildly for a moment,
then wrung father's hand, paid him a month's board in advance,
and broke down and sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>In the days that followed he was moody and unapproachable.
He lived, of course, entirely in the drawing-room, and the lack
of air and exercise began to tell sadly on his health. He passed
his time in drinking tea and looking at photographs. He would
stand for hours together gazing at the photograph of father's
uncle's friend in his Bengal uniform&mdash;talking to it, sometimes
swearing bitterly at it. His mind was visibly failing.</p>

<p>At length the crash came. They carried him up-stairs in a
raging delirium of fever. The illness that followed was terrible.
He recognized no one, not even father's uncle's friend in his
Bengal uniform. At times he would start up <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>from his bed and
shriek: "Well, I think I&mdash;&mdash;" and then fall back upon the pillow
with a horrible laugh. Then, again, he would leap up and cry:
"Another cup of tea and more photographs! More photographs!
Hear! Hear!"</p>

<p>At length, after a month of agony, on the last day of his vacation
he passed away. They say that when the last moment came,
he sat up in bed with a beautiful smile of confidence playing
upon his face, and said: "Well&mdash;the angels are calling me; I'm
afraid I really must go now. Good afternoon."</p>

<h3>THE FOXES' TAILS<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Weel, Sandy, man; and how did ye like the sermon
the day?</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;Eh?</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;What did you think o' the discourse as a whole?</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;All I was gaun to say was jeest this, that every
noo and then in your discoorse the day&mdash;I dinna say oftener
than noo and then&mdash;jeest occasionally&mdash;it struck me that there
was maybe&mdash;frae time to time&mdash;jeest a wee bit o' <i>exaggeration</i>.</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Exagger&mdash;what, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;Weel, maybe that's ower strong a word, I dinna
want to offend ye. I mean jeest&mdash;<i>amplification</i>, like.</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Exaggeration! amplification! What the deil mischief
d'ye mean, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;There, there, there! I'll no say anither word. I
dinna mean to rouse ye like that. All I meant to say was that
you jeest <i>streetched the pint</i> a wee bit.</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;<i>Streetched the pint!</i> D'ye mean to say, Sir, that I
tell <i>lees</i>?</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;Oh! no, no, no&mdash;but I didna gang sae far as a'
that.</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Ye went quite far enough, Sir. Sandy, I call upon
you, if ever ye should hear me say another word out o' joint,
to pull me up there and then.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;Losh! Sir; but how could I pull ye up i' the kirk?</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Ye can give me sort o' a signal.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;How could I gie ye a signal i' the kirk?</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Ye could make some kind o' a noise.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;A noise i' the kirk?</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Ay. Ye're sittin' just down aneath me, ye ken; so
ye might just put up your held, and give a bit whustle (whistles),
like that.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;A whustle!</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Ay, a whustle!</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;But would it no be an awfu' sin?</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Hoots, man; doesna the wind whustle on the Sawbbath?</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;Ay; I never thought o' that afore. Yes, the wind
whustles.</p>

<p><i>Minister</i>&mdash;Well, just a wee bit soughing whustle like the wind
(whistles softly).</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i>&mdash;Well, if there's nae harm in 't, I'll do my best.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>
<p>So, ultimately, it was agreed between the minister and precentor,
that the first word of exaggeration from the pulpit was
to elicit the signal from the desk below.</p>

<p>Next Sunday came. Had the minister only stuck to his sermon
that day, he would have done very well. But it was his
habit, before the sermon, to read a chapter from the Bible, adding
such remarks and explanations of his own as he thought necessary.
On the present occasion he had chosen one that bristled with
difficulties. It was that chapter which describes Samson as catching
three hundred foxes, tying them tail to tail, setting firebrands
in their midst, starting them among the standing corn of the
Philistines, and burning it down. As he closed the description,
he shut the book, and commenced the <i>eloocidation</i> as follows:</p>

<p>"My dear freends, I daresay you have been wondering in your
minds how it was possible that Samson could catch three hundred
foxes.</p>

<p>"Well, then, we are told in the Scriptures that Samson was
the strongest man that ever lived. But, we are not told that he
was a great runner. But if he catched these three hundred foxes
he must have been a great runner, and therefore I contend that
we have a perfect right to assume, by all the laws of Logic and
Scientific History, that he was the fastest runner that ever was
born; and that was how he catched his three hundred foxes!</p>

<p>"But after we get rid of this difficulty, my freends, another
crops up&mdash;after he has catched his three hundred foxes, how
does he manage to keep them all together?</p>

<p>"Now you will please bear in mind, in the <i>first place</i>, that it
was <i>foxes</i> that Samson catched. Now we don't catch foxes, as a
general rule, in the streets of a <i>toon</i>; therefore it is more than
probable that Samson catched them in the <i>country</i>, and if he
catched them in the country it is natural to suppose that he
'bided in the country; and if he 'bided in the country it is not
unlikely that he lived at a farm-house. Now at farm-houses we
have stables and barns, and <i>therefore</i> we may now consider it a
settled pint, that as he catched his foxes, one by one, he stapped
them into a good-sized barn, and steeked the door and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>locked it,&mdash;<i>here
we overcome the second stumbling-block</i>. But no sooner
have we done this, than a third rock of offense loups up to fickle
us. After he has catched his foxes; after he has got them all
snug in the barn under lock and key&mdash;<i>how in the world did he
tie their tails together?</i> There is a fickler. But it is a great thing
for poor, ignorant folk like you, that there has been great and
learned men who have been to colleges, and universities, and
seats o' learning&mdash;the same as mysel', ye ken&mdash;and instead o'
going into the kirk, like me, they have gone traveling into foreign
parts; and they have written books o' their travels; and we
can read their books. Now, among other places, some of these
learned men have traveled into <i>Canaan</i>, and some into <i>Palestine</i>,
and some few into the <i>Holy Land</i>; and these last mentioned travelers
tell us, that in these Eastern or Oriental climes, the foxes
there are <i>a total different breed o' cattle a'thegither frae our foxes</i>;
that they are <i>great, big beasts</i>&mdash;and, what's the most astonishing
thing about them, and what helps to explain this wonderful feat
of Samson's, is, that they've all got <i>most extraordinary long tails</i>;
in fact, these Eastern travelers tell us that these foxes' tails are
actually <i>forty feet long</i>.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i> (whistles).</p>

<p><i>Minister</i> (somewhat disturbed)&mdash;"Oh! I ought to say that there
are <i>other travelers</i>, and <i>later travelers</i> than the travelers I've been
talking to you about, and they say this statement is rather an
<i>exaggeration</i> on the whole, and that these foxes' tails are never
more than <i>twenty feet long</i>.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i> (whistles).</p>

<p><i>Minister</i> (disturbed and confused)&mdash;"Be&mdash;be&mdash;before I leave
this subject a'thegither, my freends, I may just add that there
has been a considerable diversity o' opinion about the length o'
these animals' tails. Ye see one man says one thing, and anither,
anither; and I've spent a good lot o' learned research in the matter
mysel'; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>after examining one authority, and anither authority,
and putting one authority again the ither, I've come to the
conclusion that these foxes' tails, on an average, are seldom more
than <i>fifteen and a half feet long</i>.</p>

<p><i>Precentor</i> (whistles).</p>

<p><i>Minister</i> (angrily)&mdash;"Sandy McDonald, I'll no tak anither inch
off o' the beasts' tails, even gin ye should whustle every tooth oot
o' your head. Do ye think the foxes o' the Scriptures had na
tails at a'?"</p>

<h3>THE WEATHER FIEND<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>One hot day last summer, a young man dressed in thin clothes,
entered a Broadway car, and seating himself opposite a stout old
gentleman, said, pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Pretty warm, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What's pretty warm?"</p>

<p>"Why, the weather."</p>

<p>"What weather?"</p>

<p>"Why, this weather."</p>

<p>"Well, how's this different from any other weather?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is warmer."</p>

<p>"How do you know it is?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is."</p>

<p>"Isn't the weather the same everywhere?"</p>

<p>"Why, no,&mdash;no; it's warmer in some places and it's colder in
others."</p>

<p>"What makes it warmer in some places than it's colder in
others?"</p>

<p>"Why, the sun,&mdash;the effect of the sun's heat."</p>

<p>"Makes it colder in some places than it's warmer in others?
Never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>"No, no, no. I didn't mean that. The sun makes it warmer."</p>

<p>"Then what makes it colder?"</p>

<p>"I believe it's the ice."</p>

<p>"What ice?"</p>

<p>"Why, the ice,&mdash;the ice,&mdash;the ice that was frozen by&mdash;by&mdash;by
the frost."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span></p>
<p>"Have you ever seen any ice that wasn't frozen?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;that is, I believe I haven't."</p>

<p>"Then what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I was just trying to talk about the weather."</p>

<p>"And what do you know about it,&mdash;what do you know about
the weather?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I knew something, but I see I don't and that's
a fact."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I should say you didn't! Yet you come into this car
and force yourself upon the attention of a stranger and begin
to talk about the weather as tho you owned it, and I find you
don't know a solitary thing about the matter you yourself selected
for a topic of conversation. You don't know one thing
about meteorological conditions, principles, or phenomena; you
can't tell me why it is warm in August and cold in December;
you don't know why icicles form faster in the sunlight than they
do in the shade; you don't know why the earth grows colder as
it comes nearer the sun; you can't tell why a man can be sun-struck
in the shade; you can't tell me how a cyclone is formed
nor how the trade-winds blow; you couldn't find the calm-center
of a storm if your life depended on it; you don't know what a
sirocco is nor where the southwest monsoon blows; you don't
know the average rainfall in the United States for the past and
current year; you don't know why the wind dries up the ground
more quickly than a hot sun; you don't know why the dew falls
at night and dries up in the day; you can't explain the formation
of fog; you don't know one solitary thing about the weather
and you are just like a thousand and one other people who
always begin talking about the weather because they don't know
anything else, when, by the Aurora Borealis, they know less about
the weather than they do about anything else in the world, sir!"</p>

<h3>THE WAY OF A WOMAN<br />
BY BYRON W. KING</h3>

<p>It was the last night before leap-year; it was the last hour before
leap-year; in fact, the minute-hand had moved round the dial
face of the clock until it registered fifteen minutes of twelve,&mdash;fifteen
minutes of leap-year. John and Mary were seated in
Mary's father's parlor. There was plenty of furniture there but
they were using only a limited portion of it. John watched the
minute-hand move round the dial face of the clock until, like the
finger of destiny, it registered fifteen minutes of twelve,&mdash;fifteen
minutes of leap-year, when he gasped hard, clutched his coat
collar, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mary, in just fifteen minutes, Mary,&mdash;fifteen minutes by that
clock, Mary,&mdash;another year, Mary,&mdash;like the six thousand years
that have gone before it, Mary,&mdash;will have gone into the great
Past and be forgotten in oblivion, Mary,&mdash;and I want to ask <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>you,
Mary,&mdash;to-night, Mary,&mdash;on this sofa, Mary,&mdash;if for the next six
thousand years,&mdash;Mary!!!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John," she said with a winning smile, "you seem very much
excited, John,&mdash;can I do anything to help you, John?"</p>

<p>"Just sit still, Mary,&mdash;just sit still. In just twelve minutes,
Mary,&mdash;twelve minutes by this clock, Mary,&mdash;like the six thousand
clocks that have gone before it, Mary,&mdash;will be forgotten,
Mary,&mdash;and I want to ask this clock, Mary,&mdash;to-night, on this
sofa, Mary,&mdash;if when we've been forgotten six thousand times,
Mary,&mdash;in oblivion, Mary,&mdash;and six thousand sofas, Mary!!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John," she said, more smilingly than ever, "you seem quite
nervous; would you like to see father?"</p>

<p>"Not for the world, Mary, not for the world! In just eight
minutes, Mary,&mdash;eight minutes by that awful clock, we'll be forgotten,
Mary,&mdash;and I want to ask six thousand fathers, Mary,&mdash;if
when this sofa, Mary,&mdash;has been forgotten six thousand times,
Mary,&mdash;in six thousand oblivions,&mdash;I want to ask six thousand
Marys six thousand times, Mary!!!!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John," she said, "you don't seem very well. Would you like
a glass of water?"</p>

<p>"Mary,&mdash;in just three minutes, Mary,&mdash;three minutes by that
dreadful clock, Mary,&mdash;we'll be forgotten, Mary,&mdash;six thousand
times,&mdash;and I want to ask six thousand sofas, Mary,&mdash;if when
six thousand oblivions have forgotten six thousand fathers in six
thousand years, I want to ask six thousand Marys, six thousand
times, Mary!!!!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang! the clock struck. It was leap-year. The clock struck
twelve and Mary turning to John, sweetly said:</p>

<p>"John, it's leap-year; will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"Yes!!!"</p>

<p>Gentlemen, there is no use talking, the way of a woman beats
you all.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;Mr. Commodore&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;I assure

me&mdash;swell within me&mdash;swell within me&mdash;what makes my heart
swell within me&mdash;why does it swell&mdash;swell within me? (<i>Turns round

did he do?&mdash;in the few confused&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Strikes dramatic
attitude with swelled chest and outstretched arm, preparing

upon the ship of state&mdash;he stood upon the maintopgallant-jib-boomsail

waging rildly round to wreck his fragile bark, through all the
howling tempest he guided her in safety into the harbor of perdition&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;into
the haven of safety. And what did he do
then? What did he do then? What did he do then? He&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;(<i>looks

gathered round him&mdash;they gathered round George Washington&mdash;they
placed him on the summit of the cipadel&mdash;their capadol&mdash;they
held him up before the eyes of the assembled world&mdash;around
his brow they placed a never-dying wreath&mdash;and then in
thunder tones which all the world might hear&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Flourishes MS.

<h3>INTRODUCIN' THE SPEECHER<br />
BY EDWIN L. BARKER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Introductory Remarks.</span> This selection is a little caricature,
introducing two characters. "The Speecher" is one of those young
men who has passed through college in one year,&mdash;passed <i>through</i>,&mdash;and
has increasing difficulty in finding a hat large enough to fit
his head. His oratorical powers have been praised by his friends,
and he never misses an opportunity to exhibit his "great natural
talent." "The Chairman" is frequently met in the smaller towns.
He has lived there a long time, is acquainted with everybody,
makes it a point to form the acquaintance of all newcomers, takes
an interest in public affairs, and is often called upon to introduce
the speakers who visit the town. His principal weakness is that
in the course of his introductory remarks he usually says more
than the speaker himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chairman.</span> (<i>Comes forward to table at center, stands at
right, looks nervously at audience, goes to left of table, does not
know what to do with hands, returns to right of table, begins in
high, nervous voice.</i>) "Gentlemen an' ladies&mdash;an' the rest on ye&mdash;(<i>goes
left of table</i>) I s'pose ye all knowed afore, as per'aps ye
do now, that I did not come out to make a speech; but to&mdash;to
'nounce the speecher. Now, the speecher has jes come, an' is
right in there. (<i>Points with thumb over shoulder to L. and goes
R. of table.</i>) I don't know why 'twas they called on me to 'nounce
the speecher, unless it is that I've lived here in your midst <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>fer a
long while, an' am 'quainted with very nigh every one fer four
or five miles about, an' I s'pose that's why they called on me to&mdash;to
'nounce the speecher. Now, the speecher is&mdash;right in there.
(Points L. and goes L.) I s'pose I'm as well calc'lated to 'nounce
the speecher as any on ye, an' I s'pose that's why I'm here to&mdash;to
'nounce the speecher. Now, the speecher is&mdash;right in there.
(<i>Points L. and goes R.</i>) You know I've lived here in your midst a
long time, an' have allus tuk an active part in all public affairs,
an' I s'pose that's why they called on me to&mdash;to 'nounce the
speecher. Now, the speecher is right in there. (<i>Points L. and
goes L.</i>) As I said once afore, I've lived here in your midst fer
a long time, an' have allus tuk active part in all public affairs,
an' public doin's ginerally. Ye know I was 'pinted tax collector
once, an' was road-overseer fer a little while, an' run fer constable
of this here township&mdash;but I&mdash;I didn't git it. (<i>Quickly.</i>) Now,
the speecher is&mdash;right there. (<i>Points L. and goes R. Wipes forehead
with handkerchief.</i>) I jes want to say a word to the young
men this evenin'&mdash;as I see quite a sprinklin' of 'em here&mdash;an'
that is that I'd like fer all the young men to grow up an' hold
high and honorable offices like I've done. But there, I can't stop
any longer, 'cause the speecher is&mdash;right in there. (<i>Starts to go,
but returns.</i>) Now, I don't want you to think I don't want to
talk to ye, fer I do. I do so like to talk to the young men, an' the
old men, an' them that are not men. (<i>Smiles.</i>) I love to talk to
ye. But, of course, I can't talk to you now, 'cause the speecher
is&mdash;right in there. (<i>Points L.</i>) But some other time when the
speecher's not here&mdash;I think there'll be a time afore long&mdash;why,
I'll talk to you. (<i>Grows confused.</i>) Of course, you know, I'd
talk to you now; but&mdash;uh&mdash;that is&mdash;I think there'll be a time
afore long&mdash;at some other&mdash;you know&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;the&mdash;(<i>desperately</i>)
the speecher is right in there. (<i>Rushes to L., stops, and
with back to audience, concludes.</i>) I will now interdoose to ye
Charles William Albright, of Snigger's Crossroads, a very promisin'
young attorney of that place, who will talk to ye. As I said afore,
the speecher is right in here. Now, the speecher is right out there."
(<i>While standing with back to audience, run fingers through hair
to give it a long, scholarly appearance, put on glasses, and take
from chair roll of paper and place under arm. To be effective,
this paper should be about one foot wide and ten feet long, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>folded
in about five or six-inch folds. At conclusion of chairman's speech,
turn and walk to table as the speecher.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Speecher.</span> (<i>Walks to table with a strut. Face should have
a wise, solemn, self-satisfied expression. Stops at table, surveys
the audience with solemn dignity, clears the throat, lays roll of
paper on table, takes out handkerchief, clears throat, wipes mouth,
smacks lips, lays handkerchief on table, surveys audience again,
slowly unrolls paper and lays on table, surveys audience again,
clears throat, wipes mouth, smacks lips, poses with one hand on
table.</i>) "Ladies&mdash;and&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;and fellow citizens. (<i>Rises on
toes and comes back on heels, as practised by some public speakers.</i>)
I have fully realized the magnitude of this auspicious occasion,
and have brought from out the archives of wisdom one of
those bright, extemporaneous subjects, to which, you know, I always
do (<i>rising inflection</i>) ample justice. (<i>Rises on toes, clears
throat, applies handkerchief to forehead.</i>) The subject for this
evening's discussion (<i>very solemn</i>) is coal oil. (<i>Clears throat and
looks wise.</i>) Now, the first question that arises is: How do they
get it? (<i>In measured tone, on toes, tapping words off on fingers
of left hand with forefinger of right hand.</i>) How&mdash;do&mdash;they&mdash;get&mdash;it?
(<i>Soaringly.</i>) My dear friends, some get it by the pint, and
some by the quart. (<i>Clears throat, wipes perspiration from forehead.</i>)
But, you say, how do they get it in the first place? (<i>Tragically.</i>)
Ah, my dear friends, as Horace Greeley has so fittingly exprest
it&mdash;that is the question. (<i>Quickly.</i>) But I will explain. When
they want to get it they take a great, mammoth auger (<i>imitates</i>)
and they bore, and they bore, and they bore, and&mdash;(<i>looks at paper
quickly</i>)&mdash;and they bore! And when they strike the oil it just
squirts up. That's how they get it! (<i>Rises on toes, smacks lips
and looks wise.</i>) Now, you all know, coal oil is used for a great
many things. It is used for medicine, to burn in the lamp, to
blow up servant girls when they make a fire with it, and&mdash;many
other useful things. (<i>Wipes mouth and puts handkerchief in
pocket.</i>) The gentlemen in charge will now pass the hat, being
careful to lock the door back there so that none of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>those boys
from Squeedunk can get out before they chip in. (<i>Takes paper
and rolls it up.</i>) I will say that I expect to deliver another lecture
here two weeks from to-night&mdash;two weeks from to-night&mdash;upon
which occasion I would like to see all the children present, as the
subject will be of special interest to (<i>rises on toes, closes eyes</i>) the
little ones. The subject on that occasion will be 'Will We Bust
the Trusts, or Will the Trusts Bust Us?'" (<i>Puts roll of paper
under arm and stalks off as if having captured the world.</i>)</p>

<h3>COUNTING ONE HUNDRED<br />
BY JAMES M. BAILEY</h3>

<p>A Danbury man named Reubens, recently saw a statement that
counting one hundred when tempted to speak an angry word
would save a man a great deal of trouble. This statement sounded
a little singular at first, but the more he read it over the more
favorably he became imprest with it, and finally concluded to
adopt it.</p>

<p>Next door to Reubens lives a man who made five distinct attempts
in a fortnight to secure a dinner of green peas by the
first of July, but has been retarded by Reubens' hens. The next
morning after Reubens made his resolution, this man found his
fifth attempt had been destroyed. Then he called on Reubens.
He said:</p>

<p>"What in thunder do you mean by letting your hens tear up
my garden?"</p>

<p>Reubens was prompted to call him various names, but he remembered
his resolution, put down his rage, and meekly said:</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mad neighbor, who had been eyeing this answer with suspicion,
broke in again:</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer my question, you rascal?"</p>

<p>But still Reubens maintained his equanimity, and went on with
the test.</p>

<p>"Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mad neighbor stared harder than ever.</p>

<p>"Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>twenty-one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're a mean thief!" said the mad neighbor, backing toward
the fence.</p>

<p>Reubens' face flushed at this charge, but he only said:</p>

<p>"Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this figure the neighbor got up on the fence in some haste,
but suddenly thinking of his peas, he said:</p>

<p>"You mean, contemptible, old rascal! I could knock your head
against my barn and I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one,
thirty-two, thirty-three&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the neighbor ran for the house, and entering it, violently
slammed the door behind him. Reubens did not let up on the
enumeration, but stood out there alone in his own yard, and kept
on counting, while his burning cheeks and flashing eyes eloquently
affirmed his judgment. When he got up into the eighties his wife
came out to him in some alarm.</p>

<p>"Why, Reubens, man, what is the matter with you? Do come
into the house."</p>

<p>But he didn't stop.</p>

<p>"Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one,
ninety-two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she came to him, and clung tremblingly to him, but he
only turned, looked into her eyes, and said:</p>

<p>"Ninety-three, ninety-four, ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven,
ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Go into the house, old
woman, or I'll bust you!"</p>


<h3>THEY NEVER QUARRELED<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>They had been married about three weeks, and had just gone to
housekeeping. He was starting down town one morning, and she
followed him to the door. They had their arms wrapt around
each other, and she was saying:</p>

<p>"O Clarence, do you think it possible that the day can ever
come when we will part in anger?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no, little girl, of course not. What put that foolish
idea into my little birdie's head, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, dearest. I was only thinking how perfectly
dreadful it would be if one of us should speak harshly to the
other."</p>

<p>"Well, don't think of such wicked, utterly impossible things any
more. We can never, never, never quarrel."</p>

<p>"I know it, darling. Good-by, you dear old precious, good-by,
and&mdash;oh, wait a second, Clarence; I've written a note to mamma;
can't you run around to the house and leave it for her some time
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, dearie; if I have time."</p>

<p>"If you have time? O Clarence!"</p>

<p>"What is it, little girlie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to say 'if you have time' to do almost the very first errand
your little wife asks you to do."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I expect to be very busy to-day."</p>

<p>"Too busy to please me? O Clarence, you hurt my feelings
so."</p>

<p>"Why, child, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not a child, I'm a married woman, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, my pet. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Clarence, if I were your p&mdash;p&mdash;pet you'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Mabel, do be reasonable."</p>

<p>"O Clarence! don't speak to me so."</p>

<p>"Mable, be sensible, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, Clarence, go on; break my heart."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense."</p>

<p>"Oh! o&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>"What have I said or done?"</p>

<p>"As if you need ask! But go&mdash;hate me if you will, Clarence,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is rank nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I'll go back to mamma if you want me to. She loves me, if
you don't."</p>

<p>"You must have a brain-storm!"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, sneer at me, ridicule me, break my poor heart. Perhaps
you had better strike me!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span></p>
<p>He bangs the door, goes down the steps on the jump, and races
off, muttering something about women being the "queerest
creatures."</p>

<p>Of course, they'll make it up when he comes home, and they'll
have many a little tiff in the years to come, and when they grow
old they'll say:</p>

<p>"We've lived together forty-five years, and in all that time have
never spoken a cross word to each other!"</p>

<h3>THE VILLAGE ORACLE<br />
BY J. L. HARBOUR</h3>

<p>"Why, Mis' Farley, is it really you? It's been so long sence
I saw you that I hardly knowed you. Come in an' set down. I
was jest a-wishin' some one would come in. I've felt so kind of
downsy all mornin'. I reckon like enough it is my stummick.
I thought some of goin' to see old Doctor Ball about it, but, la, I
know jest what he'd say. He'd look at my tongue an' say,
'Coffee,' an' look cross. He lays half the mis'ry o' the world to
coffee. Says it is a rank pizen to most folks, an' that lots o' the
folks now wearin' glasses wouldn't need 'em if they'd let coffee
alone. Says it works on the ocular nerves an' all that, but I
reckon folks here in Granby will go on drinkin' coffee jest the
same.</p>

<p>"You won't mind if I keep right on with my work, will you,
seein' that it ain't nothin' but sewin' carpet-rags? I've got to
send my rags to the weaver this week, or she can't weave my
carpet until after she comes home from a visit she 'lows on makin'
to her sister over in Zoar. It's just a hit-er-miss strip o' carpet
I'm makin' for my small south chamber. I set out to make somethin'
kind o' fancy with a twisted strip an' the chain in five colors,
but I found I hadn't the right kind of rags to carry it through
as I wanted to; so I jest decided on a plain hit-er-miss. I don't
use the south chamber no great nohow. It's the room my first
husband and his first wife and sev'ral of his kin all died in; so
the 'sociations ain't none too cheerin', an' I&mdash;I&mdash;s'pose you know
about Lyddy Baxter losin' her husband last week? No? Well,
he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span> went the way o' the airth, an' Lyddy wore my mournin'-veil
an' gloves to the funeral. They're as good as they were the
day I follered my two husbands to the grave in 'em. When a
body pays two dollars an' sixty-eight cents for a mournin'-veil,
it behooves 'em to take keer of it, an' not switch it out wearin'
it common as Sally Dodd did hern. If a body happens to
marry a second time, as I did, a mournin'-veil may come in
handy, jest as mine did.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lyddy's husband did go off real sudden. It was this
new-fashioned trouble, the appendysheetus, that tuk him off. They
was jest gittin' ready to op'rate on him when he went off jest
as easy as a glove. There's three thousand life-insurance; so
Lyddy ain't as bereft as some would be. Now, if she'll only
have good jedgement when she gits the money, an' not fool it
away as Mis' Mack did her husband's life-insurance. He had
only a thousand dollars, an' she put half of it on her back before
three months, an' put three hundred into a pianny she
couldn't play. She said a pianny give a house sech an air. I
up an' told her that money would soon be all 'air' if she didn't
stop foolin' it away.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want it told as comin' from me, but I've heerd that
it was her that put that advertisement in the paper about a widder
with some means wishin' to correspond with a gentleman similarly
situated with a view to matrimony. I reckon she had about
fifty dollars left at that time. I tried to worm something about
it out of the postmaster; for of course he'd know about her mail,
but he was as close as a clam-shell. I reckon one has to be kind
of discreet if one is postmaster, but he might of known that anything
he told me wouldn't go no farther if he didn't want it to.
I know when to speak an' when to hold my tongue if anybody
in this town does.</p>

<p>"Did you know that Myra Dart was goin' to marry that Rylan
chap? It's so. I got it from the best authority. An' she's nine
years an' three months an' five days older than him. I looked
it up in the town hist'ry. It's a good deal of a reesk for a man
to marry a woman that's much older than he is.</p>

<p>"But, my land, it's a good deal of a reesk to git married at
all nowadays. You never know what you're gittin' ontil it's too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
late to undo the matter. Seems to me there must be a screw
loose somewhere, or matrimony wouldn't be the fizzle it is in so
many instances. An' it's about six o' one an' half a dozen o' the
other when it comes to dividin' the blame. You know my first
husband was jestice o' the peace five years, an' he had considdable
marryin' to do, an' I saw a good deal o' what loose idees
some people had about matrimony.</p>

<p>"I recollect of one couple comin' in to git married one evenin'.
They was both in middle life, an' them kind usually acts the silliest
with the exception of a real old pair. They are the beaterees
for silly actin'. Well, my husband never married any couple
without makin' sure that there was no onlawful hindrances in
the way o' past husbands and wives, an' so he says to the woman,
'Have you ever been married before?' An' she says jest as flippant,
'Yes, but he didn't live but three weeks; so it ain't wuth
speakin' of.' Now wa'n't that scand'lous? It jest showed how
lightly some folks look on the solemn ord'nance o' matrimony.</p>

<p>"I reckon you know that the Porters have a boy at their house?
No? Well, they have. He was born at twenty minutes to one
las' night, or this mornin' ruther, an' old Susan Puffer is to do
the nussin'. I heard a wagon drive by here lickety-split at most
midnight las' night an' I sez to myself, sez I, 'I'll bet that's Hi
Porter tearin' off for old Susan Puffer', an' I got up, an'
wrapped a blanket around me, an' waited for the wagon to come
back; an' when it did, I called out, 'That you, Hi an' Susan?' It
gives 'em a good deal of a start, but Susan called out that it was
her, an' I went back to bed. Some folks would of been
curious-minded enough to of went right over to the Porters', but I ain't
that pryin' an' I didn't go over till after breakfast this mornin'.</p>

<p>"It's a real nice baby, an' it's goin' to be the livin' spit o' Hi
exceptin' for its nose, which is its mother's all over; an' its mouth
is the livin' counterpart o' its grandfather Porter's an' it's got
the Davis ears. You know its mother was a Davis. I hope it
won't have to be a bottle-riz baby. I don't care how good these
infant foods may be; I don't think that a bottle-riz baby is ever
the equal of one that ain't bottle-riz. The Lord must of intended
mothers to nuss their babies, or He wouldn't of made 'em so they
could. So I&mdash;must you be goin'? What's your hurry? I'd love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
to have you set all afternoon. It's so long sense you have been
here, an' I do so enjoy havin' the neighbors drop in an' tell me
all that's goin' on. I never go no place to hear the news. I
wish you'd come in real often an' talk to me.</p>

<p>"Looks some like rain. I hope it'll be fair to-morrow, for I
'low on goin' over to Lucindy Baxter's to spend the day. Me an'
her went over to Ware Monday, an' had a real nice all-day visit
with Lucindy's married daughter. She's real nicely fixt, an'
she had three kinds of cake besides cookies for tea. Seems to
me one kind an' the cookies would o' been plenty. Mebbe she
wanted to let us see that her husband was a good pervider.</p>

<p>"I went over to Zion Tuesday, an' Wednesday me an' Nancy
Dodd went over to Becky Means's, and helped her quilt her album
quilt; an' she had a chicken-pie for dinner that went a little
ahead of anything I ever et in the way of chicken-pie. Nancy's
a good cook anyhow. She gives a kind of a taste to things that
only a born cook can give. I'm goin' over to the fair in Greenfield
Friday; so I&mdash;do come over again soon. I git real lonesome
stayin' to home close as I do, an' it's nice to have some one come
in an' talk to me as you have. Good-by.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come over soon. But don't you wait for me. Come
when you kin. I'm allus to home. Good-by. See my little
chicks? I put a hen on thirteen eggs, an' she hatched out every
blessed one of 'em. Wa'n't she smart? An she laid all the eggs
herself, too. I got another hen comin' off on the tenth. Didn't
the minister preach beautifully Sunday? I dunno as I ever
heard a more upliftin' sermon. I see that his wife has her black
silk made up that the Ladies' Society gave her on her birthday.
Didn't seem to me it fit real well under the arms. Well,
good-by, good-by."</p>

<h3>McCARTHY AND McMANUS<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>An Irishman named Patrick McCarthy, having received an invitation
to visit some friends who were stopping at one of the
prominent hotels, suddenly realized that his best suit needed
pressing. He sent the suit to his friend Michael McManus, the
tailor, with instructions to put it in proper shape and to return
it with all haste.</p>

<p>After waiting an hour or more, he became very impatient, and
asked his wife to go for the clothes, telling her to be sure to
bring them back with her. When she returned he was surprized
to find she had not brought back his suit, and he said:</p>

<p>"Well, where are my clothes?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, don't ask me. I'm thot mad I'm almost afther
killin' thot McManus!"</p>

<p>"Pfhot's thot? Pfhot's McManus done with thim?"</p>

<p>"He's done nothin' with thim, and he barely took notice of me."</p>

<p>"Shure woman, dear, pfhot's that you be tellin' me? Did Mac
insult you,&mdash;for the love of hivins tell me quick?"</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you. Whin I wint into the shop, there was
McManus; instid of sittin' on the table as usual, he was sittin'
forninst it, with a long shate of paper spread out, and he was
a-writin' and a-writin' and a-writin'. Says I, 'Mr. McManus.'
No answer. Again I says, 'Mr. McManus.' Still no answer.
Says I, 'Look here, Mr. McManus, pfhot do you mean by kapin'
my husband waitin' for his clothes?&mdash;have you got thim done?'
Without raisin' his head he says, 'No, I haven't,' and wint on
writin' and writin'. Says I, 'He's waitin' for thim.' Says he,
'Let him wait.' Says I, 'He won't.' Says he, 'He'll have to.'
Says I, 'Pfhot do you mean by writin' thot long document, knowin'
well thot my husband is waitin' for his clothes?' Says he, 'Well,
if you must know, it's important business. Do you see thot list?'
pointin' to a long list of names. 'Well,' says he, 'thot's a list of
all the min <i>thot I can lick</i> in this neighborhood.' Says I, 'Is thot
so?' Says he, 'Yes, thot is so.' Says I, 'Mr. McManus, have you
got my husband's name on thot list?' Says he, takin' up the list
and holdin' it near my face, 'Look at thot,&mdash;the <i>very first</i> name
on the list!' and I was thot mad I couldn't talk."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me thot he had <i>my name</i> on thot list?"</p>

<p>"I do, and the <i>very first one</i>,&mdash;on the <i>very top</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, wait till I go over and see McManus."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. McCarthy entered the shop of Mr.
McManus, and said,</p>

<p>"Is McManus here?"</p>

<p>McManus replied, "He is and he's <i>very busy</i>."</p>

<p>"Is thot so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thot is so."</p>

<p>"Look here, McManus, pfhot makes you so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>busy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just doin' a little writin'."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it you're writin'?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you. I'm makin' out a list of all the min thot
I can lick in this neighborhood, and a moighty big list it is. Just
look at thot."</p>

<p>"Say Mac, is <i>my name</i> on thot list?"</p>

<p>"Is Pat McCarthy's name on this list? Well, you can just bet
your life it is, and it's the <i>very first one</i>!"</p>

<p>"Is thot so, McManus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thot's so."</p>

<p>McCarthy, taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves, said:</p>

<p>"Look here, McManus, <i>I can lick you</i>."</p>

<p>"Did you say you <i>thought</i> you could lick me?"</p>

<p>"I said I <i>can</i> lick you."</p>

<p>"You say you <i>can</i> lick me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thot's what I said."</p>

<p>"All right. <i>Off goes your name from the list.</i>"</p>

<h3>MR. DOOLEY ON THE GRIP<br />
BY FINLAY PETER DUNNE</h3>

<p>Mr. Dooley was discovered making a seasonable beverage, consisting
of one part syrup, two parts quinine, and fifteen parts
strong waters.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mr. McKenna.</p>

<p>"I have th' lah gr-rip," said Mr. Dooley, blowing his nose and
wiping his eyes. "Bad cess to it! Oh, me poor back! I feels
as if a dhray had run over it. Did ye iver have it? Ye did not?
Well, ye're lucky. Ye're a lucky man.</p>

<p>"I wint to MCGuire's wake las' week. They gave him a dacint
sind-off. No porther. An' himself looked natural, as fine a corpse
as iver Gavin layed out. Gavin tould me so himsilf. He was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
proud iv McGuire as if he owned him. Fetched half th' town in
to look at him, an' give ivry wan iv thim cards. He near frightened
ol' man Dugan into a faint. 'Misther Dugan, how old a-are
ye?' 'Sivinity-five, thanks be,' says Dugan. 'Thin,' says Gavin,
'take wan iv me cards,' he says. 'I hope ye'll not forget me,' he
says.</p>

<p>"'Twas there I got th' lah grip. Lastewise, it is me own opinion
iv it, tho th' docthor said I swallowed a bug. It don't
seem right, Jawn, f'r th' MCGuires is a clane fam'ly; but th'
docthor said a bug got into me system. 'What sort if bug?' says
I. 'A lah grip bug,' he says. 'Ye have Mickrobes in ye're lungs,'
he says. 'What's thim?' says I. 'Thim's th' lah grip bugs,' says
he. 'Ye took wan in, an' warmed it,' he says, 'an' it has growed
an' multiplied till ye're system does be full if thim,' he says, 'millions
iv thim,' he says, 'marchin' an' counter-marchin' through ye.'
'Glory be to the saints!' says I. 'Had I better swallow some insect
powdher?' I says. 'Some iv thim in me head has a fallin'
out, an' is throwin' bricks.' 'Foolish man,' says he. 'Go to bed,'
he says, 'an' lave thim alone,' he says; 'whin they find who they're
in,' he says, 'they'll quit ye.'</p>

<p>"So I wint to bed, an' waited while th' Mickrobes had fun with
me. Mondah all iv thim was quiet but thim in me stummick.
They stayed up late dhrinkin' an' carousin' an' dancin' jigs till
wurruds come up between th' Kerry Mickrobes an' thim fr'm
Wexford; an' th' whole party wint over to me left lung, where
they cud get th' air, an' had it out. Th' nex' day th' little Mickrobes
made a tobaggan slide iv me spine; an' manetime some
Mickrobes that was wurkin' f' th' tilliphone comp'ny got it in
their heads that me legs was poles, an' put on their spikes an'
climbed all night long.</p>

<p>"They was tired out th' nex' day till about five o'clock, whin
thim that was in me head begin flushin' out th' rooms; an' I knew
there was goin' to be doin's in th' top flat. What did thim Mickrobes
do but invite all th' other Mickrobes in f'r th' ev'nin'. They
all come. Oh, by gar, they was not wan iv thim stayed away.
At six o'clock they begin to move fr'm me shins to me throat.
They come in platoons an' squads an' dhroves. Some iv thim
brought along brass bands, an' more thin wan hundred thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
iv thim dhruv through me pipes on dhrays. A trolley line was
started up me back, an iv'ry car run into a wagon-load if scrap iron
at th' base if me skull.</p>

<p>"Th' Mickrobes in me head must 've done thimselves proud.
They tipped over th' chairs an' tables; an' in less time thin it
takes to tell, th' whole party was at it. They'd been a hurlin'
game in th' back iv me skull, an' th' young folks was dancin'
breakdowns an' havin' leppin matches in me forehead; but they
all stopt, to mix in. Oh, 'twas a grand shindig&mdash;tin millions
iv men, women, an childher rowlin' on th' flure, hands an' feet
goin', ice-picks an' hurlin' sticks, clubs, brick-bats, flyin' in th'

as a hen, an' dhreamt iv organizin' a Mickrobe Campaign Club
that'd sweep th' prim'ries, an' maybe go acrost an' free Ireland.
Whin I woke up, me legs was as weak as a day-old baby's, an'
me poor head impty as a cobbler's purse. I want no more iv thim.
Give me anny bug fr'm a cockroach to an aygle, save an' excipt

<h3>A RAINY DAY EPISODE<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>One morning recently as I was about to start from my home,
I noticed that it was raining very hard outside, and as I turned
to the rack to get an umbrella I was surprized to find that out of
five umbrellas there was not one in the lot I could use. On the
impulse of the moment I decided to take the whole five down town
to the umbrella hospital and have them all repaired at once.</p>

<p>Just as I started from the door my wife asked me to be sure
and bring her umbrella back as she wanted to use it that evening.
This imprest the subject of umbrellas very vividly on my mind,
so I did not fail to leave the five umbrellas to be repaired, stating
I would call for them on my way home in the evening.</p>

<p>When I went to lunch at noon it was still raining very hard,
but as I had no umbrella this simply imprest the subject <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>on my
mind. I went to a nearby restaurant, sat down at a table, and
had been there only a few minutes when a young lady came in
and sat down at the same table with me. I was first to finish,
however, and getting up I absent-mindedly picked up her umbrella
and started for the door. She called out to me and reminded
me that I had her umbrella, whereupon I returned it to
her with much embarrassment and many apologies.</p>

<p>This incident served to impress the subject more deeply on
my mind, so on my way home in the evening I called for my
umbrellas, bought a newspaper, and boarded a street-car. I was
deeply engrossed in my newspaper, having placed the five umbrellas
alongside of me in the car, but all at once I had a peculiar
feeling of someone staring at me. Suddenly I looked up from
my paper, and was surprized to see sitting directly opposite me
the same young woman I had met in the restaurant! She had
a broad smile on her face, and looking straight into my eyes she
said knowingly: "You've had a successful day, to-day, haven't
you?"</p>

<h3>BANGING A SENSATIONAL NOVELIST<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>The other day a stout woman, armed with an umbrella, and
leading a small urchin, called at the office of a New York boys'
story paper.</p>

<p>"Is this the place where they fight Indians?" she inquired of
the young man in charge. "Is this the locality where the brave
boy charges up the canyon and speeds a bullet to the heart of
the dusky redskin?" and she jerked the urchin around by the
ear and brought her umbrella down on the desk.</p>

<p>"We publish stories for boys, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to know if these are the premises on which the daring
lad springs upon his fiery mustang, and, darting through the circle
of thunderstruck savages, cuts the captive's cords and bears
him away before the wondering Indians have recovered from their
astonishment? That's the information I'm after. I want to
know if that sort of thing is perpetrated here!" and she swung
the umbrella around her head.</p>

<p>"I don't remember those specific facts, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to know if this is the precinct where the adventurous
boy jumps on the back of a buffalo and with unerring aim picks
off one by one the bloodthirsty pursuers who bite the dust at
every crack of the faithful rifle! I'm looking for the place
where that sort of thing happens!" and this time she brought
the unlucky man a tremendous whack across the back.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm in search of the shop in which the boy road-agent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>holds
the quivering stage-driver powerless with his glittering eye, while
he robs the male passengers with an adroitness born of long and
tried experience, and kisses the hands of the lady passengers
with a gallantry of bearing that bespeaks noble birth and a chivalrous
nature! I'm looking for the apartment in which that
business is transacted!"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, madam, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to be introduced to the jars in which you keep the
boy scouts of the Sierras! Show me the bins full of the boy
detectives of the prairie! Point out to me the barrels full of
boy pirates of the Spanish main!" and with each demand she
brought her umbrella down on the young man's head until he
jumped over the desk and sought safety in a neighboring canyon.</p>

<p>"I'll teach 'em!" she panted, grasping the urchin by the ear
and leading him off. "I'll teach 'em to make it good or dance.
Want to go fight Indians any more (<i>twisting the boy's ear</i>)?
Want to stand proudly upon the pinnacle of the mountain and
scatter the plain beneath with the bleeding bodies of uncounted
slain? Propose to spring upon the taffrail and with a ringing
word of command send a broadside into the richly-laden galley,
and then mercifully spare the beautiful maiden in the cabin,
that she may become your bride? Eh? Going to do it any more?"</p>

<p>The boy exprest his permanent abandonment of all the glories
enumerated.</p>

<p>"Then come along," said she, taking him by the collar. "Let
me catch you around with any more ramrods and carving knives,
and you'll think the leaping, curling, resistless prairie fire has
swept with a ferocious roar of triumph across the trembling
plains and lodged under your jacket to stay!"</p>


<h3>HOPKINS' LAST MOMENTS<br />

spoken to him once more and soothed his last moments. Why
didn't you call me?"</p>

<p><i>Hospital Orderly</i>&mdash;"I didn't think you ought to be disturbed

<p>"'Yes,' sez 'e."</p>

<p>"'I don't think I can,' sez 'e."</p>

<p>"'Well, then, 'Opkins,' sez I, 'you'll go to 'ell.'"</p>

<p>"'I suppose so,' sez 'e,"</p>

<p>"''Opkins,' sez I, 'you ought to be wery grateful as there's a
place perwided for you, and that you've got somewhere to go.'
And I think 'e 'eard, sir, for 'e just gave a little groan, turned
over, and then 'e died."

<h3>COUNTING EGGS<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>Old Moses, who sells eggs and chickens on the streets of Austin
for a living, is as honest an old negro as ever lived; but he
has the habit of chatting familiarly with his customers, hence he
frequently makes mistakes in counting out the eggs they buy.
He carries his wares around in a small cart drawn by a diminutive
donkey. He stopt in front of the residence of Mrs. Samuel
Burton. The old lady herself came out to the gate to make the
purchase.</p>

<p>"Have you any eggs this morning, Uncle Moses?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I has. Jess got in ten dozen from de kentry."</p>

<p>"Are they fresh?"</p>

<p>"Fresh? Yes, indeed! I guantees 'em, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;de hen guantees
'em."</p>

<p>"I'll take nine dozen. You can just count them into this
basket."</p>

<p>"All right, mum; (<i>he counts</i>) one, two, free, foah, five, six,
seben, eight, nine, ten. You can rely on dem bein' fresh. How's
your son comin' on de school? He must be mos' grown."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Moses; he is a clerk in a bank in Galveston."</p>

<p>"Why, how ole am de boy?"</p>

<p>"He is eighteen."</p>

<p>"You don't tole me so! Eighteen, and getting a salary already!
Eighteen (<i>counting</i>), nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,
twenty-free, twenty-foah, twenty-five. And how's your gal comin'
on? She was most growed up de last time I seed her."</p>

<p>"She is married and living in Dallas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span></p>

<p>"Wall, I declar'; how time scoots away! And you say she has
childruns? Why, how ole am de gal? She must be just about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty-three."</p>

<p>"Am dat so? (<i>Counting.</i>) Firty-free, firty-foah, firty-five,

You don't look more den forty years old yerseff."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, old man; I see you want to flatter me. When a
person gets to be fifty-three years old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifty-free! I jess dun gwinter bleeve hit; fifty-free, fifty-foah,

<p>"Dat's old, suah. Sebenty-two, sebenty-free, sebenty-foah,
sebenty-five, sebenty-six, sebenty-seben, sebenty-eight, sebenty-nine.
And your mudder? She was one ob de noblest-lookin'
ladies I eber see. You remind me ob her so much! She libed
to mos' a hundred. I bleeves she was done past a centurion when
she died."</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Moses; she was only ninety-six when she died."</p>

<p>"Den she wan't no chicken when she died, I know dat. Ninety-six,

<p>Old Mose went on his way rejoicing. A few days afterward
Mrs. Burton said to her husband:</p>

<p>"I am afraid that we will have to discharge Matilda. I am
satisfied that she steals the milk and eggs. I am positive about
the eggs, for I bought them day before yesterday, and now about
half of them are gone. I stood right there, and heard Moses
count them myself, and there were nine dozen."</p>

seat myself.</p>

<p>You don't know me, I'm thinkin,' or some of yees 'ud be noddin'
to me afore this.</p>

<p>I'm a walkin' pedestrian, a traveling philosopher; Terry O'Mulligan's
me name. I'm from Dublin, where many philosophers
before me was raised and bred. Oh, philosophy is a foine study.
I don't know anything about it, but it's a foine study. Before I
kim over I attinded an important meetin' of philosophers in
Dublin, and the discussin' and talkin' you'd hear there about the
world 'ud warm the very heart of Socrates or Aristotle himself.
Well, there was a great many <i>imminent</i> and learned min there at
the meetin,' and I was there, too; and while we was in the very
thickest of a heated argument a man comes up to me, and says
he, "Do you know what we're talkin' about?" "I do," says I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
"but I don't understand yees." "Could you explain the sun's
motion round the earth?" says he. "I could," says I; "but I'd
not know could you understand me or not." "Well," says he,
"we'll see," says he.</p>

<p>Sure'n I didn't know anything how to get out of it then; so I
piled in, for, says I to meself, never let on to anyone that you
don't know anything, but make them believe that you do know all
about it. So, says I to him, takin' up me shillalah this way (<i>holding
up a very crooked stick horizontally</i>): "We will take that for
the straight line of the earth's equator." How's that for gehoggraphy?
(<i>To the audience.</i>) Oh, that was straight till the other day
I bent it in an argument.</p>

<p>"Very good" says he. "Well," says I, "now the sun rises in the
east." (<i>Placing the disengaged hand at the eastern end of the
stick.</i>) Well, he couldn't deny that; "and," says I, "he-he-he-rises
in the mornin'." No more could he deny that. "Very early," says
I; "and when he gets up he</p>

<p>Do you moine the poetry there? (<i>To the audience, with a
smile.</i>) "And he keeps on risin' an' risin' till he reaches his meridan."
"What's that?" says he. "His dinner-toime," says I.
"Sure'n that's my Latin for dinner-time. And when he gets his

<p>Oh, begorra, there's more poetry. I feel it croppin' out all
over me.</p>

<p>"There," says I, well satisfied with mesilf, "will that do for ye?"</p>

<p>"You haven't got done with him," says he.</p>

<p>"Done with him?" says I, kinder mad-like. "What more do you
want me to do with him? Didn't I bring him from the east to the
west? What more do you want?" "Oh," says he, "you have to
have him back agin in the east the next mornin'!"</p>

<p>By Saint Patrick, and wasn't I near betrayin' me ignorance.
Sure'n I thought there was a large family of suns, and they riz
one after the other; but I gathered meself quick, and says I to
him, "Well," says I, "I'm surprized you ax me that simple question.
I thought any man 'ud know" says I, "when the sun sinks
to rest in the west that er&mdash;when the sun&mdash;&mdash;" says I. "You
said that before" says he. "Well, I want to impress it strongly
upon you," says I. "When the sun sinks to rest behind the glorious
hills of the east&mdash;no, west&mdash;why, he&mdash;why, he waits till it
grows very dark and then he <i>goes back in the noight-toime</i>!"</p>

<h3>A PANTOMIME SPEECH<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>Have you ever realized what a funny thing it is to see a lot of
people talking and gesticulating and not hear a single sound from
them? The next time you are in a crowded dining-room, close
your ears with your hands, and you will be quickly converted to
the Darwinian theory.</p>

<p>This was forcibly imprest upon my mind at a political gathering.
The hall was very large, but was crowded to the doors, so
that when I reached there I was obliged to stand outside and on
my toes to see the speakers. Please remember that altho I could
in this way distinctly see the speakers, I was too far away to hear
the slightest sound. It was simply a pantomime performance to
me, and I shall try to give you a faithful representation of just
what I saw.</p>

<p>Simply say: "The Chairman." The rest is pantomime. Seat
yourself as an old man, put your right hand behind your ear as
if listening to a side remark. Repeat to the left. Evidently someone
has told you it is time to begin. Take out your watch and
compare it with the clock on the wall behind you. Bring out an
imaginary pair of spectacles, clean them with your handkerchief,
and as you put them on your nose draw down your face as old
men do. Get up with seeming difficulty. The business here is
<i>ad lib</i>. Point to the speaker of the evening, who is supposed to
be sitting at your right. By silent movements of the lips seem to
introduce him to the audience. Then suddenly remember that you
have something else to say just as you are about to sit down.
Repeat this two or three times. Then sit down at last with much
difficulty.</p>

<p>Then say aloud: "The Speaker." Impersonate him as assuming
a grandiloquent air. While he speaks in pantomime he rises on
his toes and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>makes numerous gestures. He pounds fist on table.
Someone evidently interrupts him from the audience. He looks
in that direction and then replies. He seems to say to the man to
come up on the platform or else get out of the hall. He talks for
some time as if in argument, then dodges as if something has been
thrown at him. Two or three times he has to dodge in this way
and then something seems to have struck him in the face. He
takes out his handkerchief and wipes off face and coat. Then
things are thrown at him from right and left, while he continues
to dodge. At last they come so thick that he rushes off the platform
in great alarm.</p>

<h3>THE FRECKLED-FACED GIRL<br />
(She entertains a visitor while her mother is dressing)<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>"Ma's up-stairs changing her dress," said the freckled-faced
little girl, tying her doll's bonnet-strings and casting her eye about
for a tidy large enough to serve as a shawl for that double-jointed
young person.</p>

<p>"Oh! your mother needn't dress up for me," replied the female
agent of the missionary society, taking a self-satisfied view of
herself in the mirror. "Run up and tell her to come down just
as she is in her every-day clothes, and not stand on ceremony."</p>

<p>"Oh! but she hasn't got on her every-day clothes. Ma was all
drest up in her new brown silk, 'cause she expected Miss Diamond
to-day. Miss Diamond always comes over here to show off her
nice things, and ma don't mean to get left. When ma saw you
coming, she said, 'The dickens!' and I guess she was mad about
something. Ma said if you saw her new dress she'd have to hear
all about the poor heathen, who don't have silk, and you'd ask her
for more money to buy hymn-books to send to 'em. Say, do the
nigger ladies use hymn-book leaves to do their hair up and make
it frizzy? Ma says she guesses that's all the good the books do
'em, if they ever get any books. I wish my doll was a heathen!"</p>

<p>"Why, you wicked little girl, why do you want a heathen doll?"
inquired the missionary lady, taking a mental inventory of the
new things in the parlor to get material for a homily on worldly
extravagance.</p>

<p>"So folks would send her lots of nice things to wear, and feel
sorry to have her going about naked. I ain't a wicked girl, either,
'cause Uncle Dick&mdash;you know Uncle Dick, he's been out West,
and he says I'm a holy terror, and he hopes I'll be an angel pretty
soon. Ma'll be down in a minute, so you needn't take your cloak
off. She said she'd box my ears if I asked you to. Ma's putting
on that old dress she had last year, 'cause she said she didn't want
you to think she was able to give much this time, and she needed
a new muff worse than the queen of the cannon-ball islands needed
religion. Uncle Dick says you ought to go to the islands, 'cause
you'd be safe there, and the natifs'd be sorry they was such sinners
if anybody would send you to 'em. He says he never seen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
heathen hungry enough to eat you 'less 'twas a blind one, and
you'd set a blind pagan's teeth on edge so he'd never hanker after
any more missionary. Uncle Dick's awful funny, and makes pa
and ma die laughing sometimes."</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Richard is a bad, depraved man, and ought to have
remained out West, where his style is appreciated. He sets a bad
example for little girls like you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I think he's nice. He showed me how to slide down the
banisters, and he's teaching me to whistle when ma ain't 'round.
That's a pretty cloak you've got, ain't it? Do you buy all your
good clothes with missionary money? Ma says you do."</p>

<p>Just then the freckled-faced little girl's ma came into the parlor
and kissed the missionary lady on the cheek, and said she was delighted
to see her, and they proceeded to have a real sociable chat.
The little girl's ma can't understand why a person who professes
to be so charitable as the missionary agent does should go right
over to Miss Diamond's and say such ill-natured things as she did,
and she thinks the missionary is a double-faced gossip.</p>

<h3>AMATEUR NIGHT<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>It was one of those little evening entertainments where everyone
talks at once, where everyone asks questions and does not wait
for an answer. Mrs. Fitzgibbon, the hostess, finally broke into the
babble:</p>

<p>"Sh! I want you all to be very quiet. Mr. Chooker&mdash;Mr. Chooker,&mdash;please
don't talk,&mdash;don't talk, please,&mdash;Mr. Chooker is very
excitable. Chooker,&mdash;yes, he is one of the Chookers. Young people
come off the stairs. Sh! I have very great pleasure in introducing
to you Mr. Chooker."</p>

<p>Mr. Chooker came forward with a malicious look, which seemed
to say, "You all seem to be very happy,&mdash;very jolly,&mdash;and enjoying
yourselves. Just wait a bit. I am about to recite a little
poem of my own entitled, 'The Triple Suicide!'"</p>

<p>Then came the boy of the family, a kind of child prodigy, who,
after giving a low and jerky bow, recited as follows: (<i>Here impersonate
a boy in awkward style.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"The women were crying, you know. Some were crying and
others were weeping. Those that weren't weeping were crying!"
(<i>Pauses, then bows low, and begins again.</i>)</p>

(<i>Pauses long, bows low, and begins again with great determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>and in loud voice.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i3"><i>at eyes silently weeping.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The young miss of the family, recently graduated, next gave
an original poem entitled "The Hen," as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Tell me not in mournful numbers,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Life is but an empty dream!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For the hen is dead that slumbers,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And things are not what they seem.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Life is real, life is earnest,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And the shell is not its pen,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">Was not spoken of the hen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"In the world's broad field of battle,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Lives of roosters all remind us<br /></span>

<span class="i3">"Hen-tracks that perhaps another chicken<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Some forlorn and henpecked brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">When he sees shall crow again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The gem of the evening, however, was a recitation given in
fine style by Mr. Chillingworth Chubb. He had rather a husky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
voice and a wooden arm. His memory, moreover, was defective.
The effect of his wooden arm, which was made to perform the
various actions of a real one, was highly amusing. (<i>Here the reciter
may use "Excelsior," "The Speech of Mark Antony," or
some similar selection. The left arm represents the wooden one.
The hand should wear a right-hand, white kid glove, put on wrong
way round with the finger-tips screwed into points. The arm
should be assisted in all its movements by the right one. It
should be made to move in a jerky and unnatural manner at all
its joints. A violent push at the elbow raises it suddenly aloft,
and it is brought again to the side by a tremendous slap from the
right hand. Finally, the arm appears to get out of order, and
moves violently in all directions, until at last the right hand, after
vainly trying to reach it, pins it down to a table or to some other
object. This imitation requires considerable practise, but when
properly done never fails to send an audience into fits of laughter.</i>)</p>


<h3>BOUNDING THE UNITED STATES<br />
BY JOHN FISKE</h3>

<p>Among the legends of our late Civil War there is a story of a
dinner-party, given by the Americans residing in Paris, at which
were propounded sundry toasts concerning not so much the past
and present as the expected glories of the American nation. In
the general character of these toasts, geographical considerations
were very prominent, and the principal fact which seemed to occupy
the minds of the speakers was the unprecedented bigness of
our country.</p>

<p>"Here's to the United States!" said the first speaker,&mdash;"bounded
on the north by British America, on the south by the Gulf of
Mexico, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the
Pacific Ocean!" "But," said the second speaker, "this is far too
limited a view of the subject, and, in assigning our boundaries,
we must look to the great and glorious future, which is prescribed
for us by the manifest destiny of the Anglo-Saxon race. Here's
to the United States!&mdash;bounded on the north by the North Pole,
on the east by the rising, and on the west by the setting, sun!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span></p>
<p>Emphatic applause greeted the aspiring prophecy. But here
arose the third speaker, a very serious gentleman, from the far
West. "If we are going," said this truly patriotic gentleman, "to
lessen the historic past and present, and take our manifest destiny
into account, why restrict ourselves within the narrow limits
assigned by our fellow countryman who has just sat down? I
give you the United States!&mdash;bounded on the north by the Aurora
Borealis, on the south by the precession of the equinoxes, on the
east by the primeval chaos, and on the west by the Day of
Judgment!"</p>

<h3>HE LAUGHED LAST<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>A young man was sitting in the Grand Central Depot the other
day, holding a baby in his arms, when the child began to cry so
lustily as to attract the attention of everyone around him. By
and by a waiting passenger walked over to him with a smile of
pity on his face and said:</p>

<p>"A woman gave you that baby to hold while she went to see
about her baggage, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! I tumbled to the fact as soon as I saw you.
You expect her back, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! This is rich! Looking for her every minute,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I think she'll come back."</p>

<p>"Well this makes me laugh,&mdash;ha! ha! ha! I had a woman play
that same trick on me in a Chicago depot once, but no one ever
will again. Young man, you've been played on for a hayseed.
I would advise you to turn that baby over to a policeman and get
out of here before some newspaper reporter gets hold of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll come back, she'll come back."</p>

<p>"She will, eh? Ha! ha! ha! The joke grows richer and richer.
Now what makes you think she'll come back?"</p>

<p>"Because she's my wife and this is our baby."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;um&mdash;I see," muttered the fat man, who got over feeling
tickled all at once, and seeing a dog that a farmer had tied to
one of the seats with a piece of clothes-line, he went over and

<h3>NORAH MURPHY AND THE SPIRITS<br />

<p>"Well, I wint to me room ter dress mesel', an' whin I got on
me sale-shkin sack, I thought av me poor ould mother&mdash;may the
hivins be her bed!&mdash;could only see me, how kilt she'd be intoirely.
Whin I was drest I wint down-stairs an' out the front-doore, an'
I tell yer <i>I slammed it well after me</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, me dear, whin I got ter the majum's, a big chap wid
long hair and a baird like a billy-goat kem inter the room.
Sez he:</p>

<p>"'Do yer want ter see the majum?'</p>

<p>"'I do,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'Two dollars,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'For what?' sez I.</p>

<p>"'For the sayants,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Faix, it's no aunts I want ter see,' sez I, 'but Luke Corrigan's
own self.' Well, me dear, wid that he giv a laugh ye'd
think would riz the roof.</p>

<p>"'Is he yer husband?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'It's mighty 'quisitive ye are,' sez I, 'but he's not me husband,
av yer want ter know, but I want ter larn av it's alive or dead
he is, which the Lord forbid!'</p>

<p>"'Yer jist in the nick o' time,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Faix, Ould Nick's here all the time, I'm thinkin', from what
I hear,' sez I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p>

<p>"Well, ter make a long story short, I paid me two dollars, an'
wint into another room, an' if ye'd guess from now till Aisther,
ye'd never think what the majum was. As I'm standin' here,
'twas <i>nothin' but a woman</i>! I was that bet, I was almost spacheless.</p>

<p>"'Be sated, madam,' sez she, p'intin' to a chair, 'yer must jine
the circle.'</p>

<p>"'Faix, I'll ate a triangle, av yer wish,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'Yer must be very quiet,' sez she. An' so I set down along
a lot av other folks at a table.</p>

<p>"'First I'll sing a hymn,' sez the majum, 'an' thin do all yees
jine in the chorus.'</p>

<p>"Yer must excuse me, mum,' sez I. 'I niver could sing, but
rather than spile the divarshun of the company, av any wan'll
whistle, I'll dance as purty a jig as ye'll see from here to Bal'nasloe,
tho it's meself as sez it.'</p>

<p>"Two young whipper-snappers begun ter laugh, but the look
I gev them shut them up.</p>

<p>"Jist then, the big chap as had me two dollars kem into the
room an' turned down the lights. In a minit the majum, shtickin'
her face close to me own, whispers:</p>

<p>"'The sperrits is about&mdash;I kin feel them!'</p>

<p>"'Thrue for you, mum,' sez I, 'fur I kin shmell them!'</p>

<p>"'Hush, the influence is an me,' sez the majum. 'I kin see the
lion an' the lamb lying down together.'</p>

<p>"'Bedad! it's like a wild beastess show,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'Will yer be quiet?' sez an ould chap next ter me. 'I hev a
question to ax.'</p>

<p>"'Ax yer question,' sez I, 'an' I'll ax mine. I paid me two
dollars, an' I'll not be put down.'</p>

<p>"'Plaze be quiet,' sez the majum, 'or the sperrits 'll lave.'</p>

<p>"Jist then came a rap on the table.</p>

<p>"'Is that the sperrit of Luke Corrigan?' sez the majum.</p>

<p>"'It is not,' sez I, 'for he could bate any boy in Killballyowen,
an' if his fisht hit that table 'twould knock it to smithereens.'</p>

<p>"'Whist!' sez the majum, 'it's John Bunion.'</p>

<p>"'Ax him 'bout his progress,' sez a woman wid a face like a
bowl of stirabout.</p>

<p>"'Ah, batherashin!' sez I. 'Let John's bunion alone, an' bring
Luke Corrigan to the fore.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span></p>
<p>"'Hish!' whispers the majum, 'I feel a sperrit near me.'</p>

<p>"'Feel av it has a lump on his nose,' sez I, 'for be that token
ye'll know it's Luke.'</p>

<p>"'The moment is suspicious,' sez the majum.</p>

<p>"'I hope yer don't want to asperge me character,' sez I.</p>

<p>"'Whist!' sez she, 'the sperrits is droopin'.'</p>

<p>"'It's droppin' yer mane,' sez I, pickin' up a shmall bottle she
let fall from her pocket.</p>

<p>"'Put that woman out,' sez an ould chap.</p>

<p>"'Who do you call a woman?' sez I. 'Lay a fing-er on me,
an' I'll scratch a map of the County Clare on yer ugly phiz.'</p>

<p>"'Put her out!' 'Put her out!' sez two or three others, an'
they made a lep for me. But, holy rocket! I was up in a minute.</p>

<p>"'Bring on yer fightin' sperrits,' I cried, 'from Julis Sazar to
Tim Macould, an' I'll bate them all, for the glory of Ireland!'</p>

<p>"The big chap as had me money kem behind me, and put his
elbow in me eye; but, me jewel, I tossed him over as ef he'd bin
a feather, an' the money rolled out his pocket. Wid a cry of
'Faugh-a-ballah!' I grabbed six dollars, runned out av the doore,
an' I'll niver put fut in the house again. An' that's how I kem
be the black eye."</p>

<h3>PAT AND THE MAYOR<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>An Irishman named Patrick Maloney, recently landed, called
upon the mayor to see if he could give him a position on the
police force. The mayor, thinking he would have some fun with
him, said:</p>

<p>"Before I can do anything for you, you will have to pass a
Civil Service examination."</p>

<p>"Ah, dthin," said Pat, "and pfhat is the Civil Sarvice?"</p>

<p>"It means that you must answer three questions I put to you,
and if you answer them correctly I may be able to place you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Pat, "I think I can answer dthim if they're not
too hard."</p>

<p>"The first question is, 'What is the weight of the moon?'"</p>

<p>"Ah, now, how can I tell you that? Shure and I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, try the second one, 'How many stars are in the sky?'"</p>

<p>"Now you're pokin' fun at me. How do I know how many
Stars there are in the shky?"</p>

<p>"Then try the third question, and if you answer it correctly
I'll forgive you the others, 'What am I thinking of?'"</p>

<p>"Pfhat are you thinkin' of? Shure, how can any man tell
what you politicians are thinkin' about. Bedad I don't belave
you know pfhat you're thinkin' about yourself. I guess I'll be
lookin' for work ilsewhere, so good-day to you!"</p>

<p>The mayor called Pat back and told him not to be discouraged,
but to go home and think about it, and if on the morrow he
thought he could answer the questions to come down again and he
would give him another chance.</p>

<p>So Pat went home and told his brother Mike about it, whereupon
Mike said:</p>

<p>"Now you give me dthim clothes of yours and I'll go down and
answer his questions for him."</p>

<p>So next morning Mike went down bright and early, and the
mayor recognizing Patrick as he thought, said:</p>

<p>"Ah, good morning, Patrick. Have you really come back to
answer those three questions I put to you yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yis, I have."</p>

<p>"Well the first question is, 'What is the weight of the moon?'"</p>

<p>"The weight of the moon is one hundred pounds, twenty-five
pounds to each quarther, four quarthers make one hundred."</p>

<p>"Capital, Patrick, capital! Now the second question is, 'How
many stars are in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>sky?'"</p>

<p>"How many shtars are in the shky? There are four billion,

<h3>UPS AND DOWNS OF MARRIED LIFE<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>A well-drest woman walked into a prominent New York office
building the other day and took one of the elevators. Her husband
saw her from across the street, and hurrying over took the
next elevator. He went to the office where he knew she had
business, and found she had stept in only for a moment and had
gone down again.</p>

<p>The elevator despatcher said to her: "Your husband just went
up, and I think he's looking for you."</p>

<p>She took the next elevator up. Just then her husband came
down. He looked all around and then inquired:</p>

<p>"Have you seen my wife here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she went up this minute."</p>

<p>He took the next elevator and was just out of sight when she
came down.</p>

<p>"Your husband has just gone up."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go right up, as he'll wait for me this time."</p>

<p>Down came her husband a second afterward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span></p>
<p>"Did my wife come down again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and just went up. She thought you'd wait for her."</p>

<p>After waiting a few moments he became impatient and went
up again. She had been waiting for him, and came down.</p>

<p>"Husband just gone up."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait here, as he will surely come down."</p>

<p>She waited a few moments and then hurried up again just as
he came down.</p>

<p>"Wife here?"</p>

<p>"Just gone up!"</p>

<p>"Well I'm going home and you tell her&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, turned
around and went up again. Down she came.</p>

<p>"Did he come down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he's gone up again as mad as a hornet."</p>

<p>"Then I had better go right up."</p>

<p>Up she went and down he came.</p>

<p>"Just gone up."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged if I'm going up again. No, sir! I've
seen many ups and downs in my time, but this is the limit. I'm
going to sit right here and wait if she never comes down!"</p>

<p>When they closed the building for the night, he was still sitting
down-stairs, and she, equally determined, was waiting up-stairs,
while the elevator man remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, I hope dey'll meet in heav'n!"

<h3>THE CROOKED MOUTH FAMILY<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>In a locality not far removed from the city's busy hum, there
lived a family noted for certain remarkable peculiarities of facial
distortion. In the father the lower jaw protruded; in the mother
it receded so that the upper jaw overhung it like a canopy; the
daughter had her face drawn to the left side, while the son had
his drawn to the right, and in addition to this deformity stammered
most dreadfully. While he attempted to talk his face
assumed an expression equally grotesque as the caricatures in a
yellow journal.</p>

<p>The father kept a store and one day a man entered whose face,
strangely enough, was drawn strongly to the right side. Addressing
the daughter, who was standing back of the counter, he said,
"I want a pound of tea," his words coming from the corner of
his mouth.</p>

<p>"What are you making fun of me for?" replied the girl, her
face drawn in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"I ain't making fun of you. Can't help it. I was born this
way."</p>

<p>The young lady, however, was not satisfied that the stranger
was telling the truth, so, stepping to the door she called to her
father, "Pa, there's a man down here making fun of me."</p>

<p>The father put in an appearance and demanded of the customer
why he had made fun of his daughter.</p>

<p>"I didn't make fun of her."</p>

<p>"Yes you did," said the girl.</p>

<p>"I s-s-saw y-y-you," stammered the brother, from out the corner
of his twisted face.</p>

<p>"I tell you I didn't. I was born this way. Can't talk any other."</p>

<p>"Well," said the old man, "you would make a good match and
you ought to marry each other."</p>

<p>This proposition meeting with a favorable consideration, the
two were made one.</p>

<p>The entire family went on the wedding tour, and one night
they spent at a country inn where candles were used for purposes
of illumination. Picking up a candle the groom attempted to
blow it out, but he nearly exhausted himself in the effort without
accomplishing his purpose. The bride came to his rescue and
blew, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>and blew, and blew, but with no better result. Papa
appearing upon the scene, said, "Let me have it. I'll show you
how to do it," and he went to work with a noise that sounded like
the exhaust of a high-pressure engine, but the candle stubbornly
refused to go out. The mother, hearing the racket, then came
upon the scene, and learning of their quandary, put the candle
on her head and blew upward but the flame merely flickered as
tho fanned by a gentle zephyr. Just then they saw the watchman
passing by, so, in their extremity, they called him to their
aid and he promptly blew out the candle because he had a straight
mouth.</p>

<h3>A BIG MISTAKE<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>Recently our church has had a new minister. He is a nice, good,
sociable man; but having come from a distant State, of course
he was totally unacquainted with our people.</p>

<p>Therefore, it happened that during his pastoral calls he made
several ludicrous blunders.</p>

<p>The other evening he called upon Mrs. Hadden. She had just
lost her husband, and naturally supposed that his visit was relative
to the sad occurrence. So, after a few commonplaces had
been exchanged, she was not at all surprized to hear him remark:</p>

<p>"It was a sad bereavement, was it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," faltered the widow.</p>

<p>"Totally unexpected?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I never dreamed of it."</p>

<p>"He died in the barn, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; in the house."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;well, I suppose you must have thought a great deal of
him."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir,"&mdash;this with a vim.</p>

<p>The minister looked rather surprized, but continued:</p>

<p>"Blind <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>staggers was the disease, I believe?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," snapped the widow, "apoplexy."</p>

<p>"Indeed; you must have fed him too much."</p>

<p>"He was always capable of feeding himself, sir."</p>

<p>"Very intelligent he must have been. Died hard, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"You had to hit him on the head with an ax to put him out of
misery, I was told."</p>

<p>"Whoever told you so did not speak the truth. James died
naturally."</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the minister, in a slightly perplexed tone, "he
kicked the side of the barn down in his last agonies, did he not?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, I have been misinformed, I suppose. How old was he?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five."</p>

<p>"Then he did not do much active work. Perhaps you are better
without him, for you can easily supply his place with another."</p>

<p>"Never, sir&mdash;never will I see one as good as he."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will. He had the heaves bad, you know."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind!"</p>

<p>"Why, I recollect I saw him, one day, passing along the road,
and I distinctly recollect that he had the heaves, and walked as
if he had the string-halt."</p>

<p>"He could never have had the string-halt, for he had a cork
leg!"</p>

<p>"A cork leg!&mdash;remarkable. But really, now, didn't he have a
dangerous trick of suddenly stopping and kicking a wagon all
to pieces?"</p>

<p>"Never; he was not a madman, sir!"</p>

<p>"Probably not. But there were some good points about him."</p>

<p>"I should think so!"</p>

<p>"The way in which he carried his ears, for example."</p>

<p>"Nobody else ever noticed that particular merit; he was warm-hearted,
generous and frank!"</p>

<p>"Good qualities. How long did it take him to go a mile?"</p>

<p>"About fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"Not much of a goer. Wasn't his hair apt to fly?"</p>

<p>"He didn't have any hair. He was bald-headed."</p>

<p>"Quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span> a curiosity?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; no more of a curiosity than you are."</p>

<p>"Did you use the whip much on him?"</p>

<p>"Never, sir."</p>

<p>"Went right along without it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"He must have been a very good sort of a brute!"</p>

<p>"The idea of you coming here and insulting me!" she sobbed.
"If my husband had lived you wouldn't have done it. Your remarks
in reference to that poor, dead man have been a series of
insults. I won't stand it."</p>

<p>He colored and looked dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Are you not Mrs. Blinkers, and has not your old gray horse
died?"</p>

<p>"I never owned a h-horse, but my husband died a week ago!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the minister came out of that house with the
reddest face ever seen on mortal man.</p>

<p>"And to think," he groaned, as he strode home, "that I was
talking horse to that woman all the time, and she was talking
husband."</p>

<p>"My dear bwother." Tham alwaths called me bwother, becauthe
we never had any thisters. When we were boyths, we were
ladths together&mdash;both of us. They used to g-g-get off a pwoverb
when they thaw uth com-com-coming down the stweet. It iths
awfully good, if I could only think of it. Iths&mdash;it iths the early
bir-bir-bird&mdash;iths the early bir-bir-bird that knowths iths own
f-f-father. What nonthense that iths! How co-co-could a b-b-bird
know iths own father? Iths a withe child&mdash;iths a withe
child&mdash;iths a wise child that geths the worm. T-t-that's not wite.
Wat nonthense that iths! No pa-pa-pawent would allow hiths
child to ga-ga-gather worms. Iths a wyme. Fish of-of-of a
feather,&mdash;fish of a f-f-feather,&mdash;now what nonthense that iths!
Fish don't have feathers. Iths a b-b-bird&mdash;iths b-b-birds of a
feather,&mdash;b-b-birds of a feather&mdash;flock together. B-b-birds of a
f-f-feather! Just as if a who-who-whole flock of b-b-birds had
only one f-f-feather. They'd all catch cold. Only one b-b-bird
could have that f-f-feather, and he'd fly sidewithse. What con-confounded
nonthense that iths! Flock to-to-together! Of
courthse th-th-they'd flock together. Who ever heard of a b-b-bird
being such a f-f-fool as to g-g-go into a corner and flock by himself?
That's one of those things no fellow can find out.</p>

<p>"I wote you a letter thome time ago&mdash;&mdash;" Thath's a lie; he
d-d-didn't w-w-wite me a letter. If he had witten me a letter he
would have posted it, and I would have g-g-got it; so, of courthse,
he didn't post it, and then he didn't wite it. Thath's easy. Oh,
yeths, I thee: "but I dwopped it into the poth-potht-office without
putting any name on it." I wonder who the d-d-dickens got that
letter. I w-w-wonder if the poth-pothman iths gwoin' awound
asking for a fellow without any name. I wonder if there iths
such a fellow, a fellow without any name? If there iths any
fellow without any name, how doeths he know who he iths himself?
I-I-I wonder if thuch a fellow could get mawaid. How could he
ask a girl to take hiths name if he h-h-had no name? That's one

<p>"I have just made a startling dithcovery." Tham's alwaths

and the old nurthe iths hith m-m-mother, and Tham iths

(<i>Points to forefinger of left hand.</i>) That's Tham's m-m-mother,
and that's Tham's nurthe (<i>pointing to thumb of left hand</i>).
Tham's nurthe ith only half the size of hith m-m-mother. Well,
that's my m-m-mother (<i>pointing to second finger of left hand</i>).
I can't get my m-m-mother to stand up! (<i>All the fingers spring
up</i>.) Hello, there's a lot of other fellows' m-m-mothers. Well,
as far as I can make out, Tham hath left me no m-m-mother at all!
That's one of those things no fellow can find out.</p>

<p>"I have just purchathed an ethstate som-som-somewhere&mdash;&mdash;" Dothn't
the idiot know wh-wh-where he hath bought it? Oh,
yeth: "on the banks of the M-M-M-Mith-ith-ippi." Who iths Mit-this
Thippi? I g-g-gueth iths Tham's m-m-mother-in-law. Tham's
got mawaid. He thayths he felt awfully ner-ner-nervouths. S-s-speaking
of m-m-mother-in-lawths, I had a fwiend who had a
m-m-mother-in-law, and he didn't like her very well; and she felt
the thame way toward him; and they went away on a steamer
acwoths the ocean, and they got shipwecked, catht away on a waft,
and they floated awound in the water, living on thuch things ath
they could pick up&mdash;such ath thardines, ice-cweam, owanges, and
other canned goods that were floating awound. When that was
all gone, everybody ate everybody else. F-f-finally only himthelf
and hiths m-m-mother-in-law waths left, and they played a game
of c-c-checkers to thee who thould be eaten up&mdash;himthelf or hith
m-m-mother-in-law. He w-w-won! He thays that wath the only
time that he weally cared for his mother-in-law!</p>

<p>Oh, herthe a pothscript. "By the way, what do you think of
the f-f-following widdle?" One of Tham's widdles. "If fourteen
dogs with three legs each catch forty-eight rabbits with
seventy-six legs in twenty-five minutes, how many legs must
twenty-four rabbits have to get away from ninety-three dogs with
two legs each in half an hour!" That's one of those things no

<h3>SLANG PHRASES<br />

<p>It is not strange that children misunderstand our slang phrases.
Not long ago a gentleman about to go abroad, made the round
of the steamship. When he came back he walked up to the captain
and said: "Captain, what has become of the old steward? I do
not see anything of him this trip."</p>

<p>"The old steward,&mdash;hm,&mdash;the old steward, well, he got too big
for his breeches, and we fired him."</p>

<p>Now it happened that a little girl stood by and overheard the
conversation, and not long after a second gentleman made the
round of the ship, and coming up to a fellow traveler said:</p>

<p>"John, we do not see anything of the old steward this trip;
what do you suppose has become of him?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I do," said a small voice.</p>

<p>They looked around and saw a little girl peeping out from a
cabin door.</p>

<p>"Well, well, my little friend, could you tell us what has become
of the old steward?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a nice little girl, I am sure; was he discharged?"</p>

<h3>THE MERCHANT AND THE BOOK AGENT<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>A book agent importuned James Watson, a rich merchant,
living a few miles out of the city, until he bought a book entitled
"The Early Christian Martyrs." Mr. Watson didn't want the
book, but he bought it to get rid of the agent; then taking it
under his arm he started for the train which takes him to his
office in the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson had not been gone long before Mrs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>. Watson came
home from a neighbor's. The book agent saw her, and went in
and persuaded the wife to buy a copy of the book. She was
ignorant of the fact that her husband had bought the same book
in the morning.</p>

<p>When Mr. Watson came back in the evening, he met his wife
with a cheery smile as he said: "Well, my dear, how have you
enjoyed yourself to-day? Well, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! had an early caller this morning."</p>

<p>"Ah, and who was she?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't a 'she' at all; it was a gentleman&mdash;a book agent."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A book agent, and, to get rid of his importuning, I bought his
book, the 'Early Christian Martyrs.' See, here it is."</p>

<p>"I don't want to see it."</p>

<p>"Why, husband?"</p>

<p>"Because that rascally book agent sold me the same book this
morning. Now we've got two copies of the same book&mdash;two
copies of the 'Early Christian Martyrs,' and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, husband, we can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, we can't, either! The man is off on the train before this.
Confound it! I could kill the fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, there he goes to the depot now!" said Mrs. Watson,
pointing out of the window at the retreating form of the book
agent making for the train.</p>

<p>"But it's too late to catch him, and I'm not drest. I've taken
off my boots, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Stevens, a neighbor of Mr. Watson, drove by,
when Mr. Watson pounded on the window-pane in a frantic
manner, almost frightening the horse.</p>

<p>"Here, Stevens! You're hitched up! Won't you run your horse
down to the train and hold that book agent till I come? Run!
Catch 'im now!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Mr. Stevens, whipping up his horse and tearing
down the road.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens reached the train as the conductor shouted, "All
aboard!"</p>

<p>"Book agent!" he yelled, as the book agent stept on the train.
"Book agent! hold on! Mr. Watson wants to see you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span></p>
<p>"Watson? Watson wants to see me?" repeated the seemingly
puzzled book agent. "Oh, I know what he wants; he wants to buy
one of my books; but I can't miss the train to sell it to him."</p>

<p>"If that is all he wants, I can pay for it and take it to him.
How much is it?"</p>

<p>"Two dollars for the 'Early Christian Martyrs,'" said the book
agent as he reached for the money and passed the book out the
car-window.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Watson arrived, puffing and blowing, in his shirt
sleeves. As he saw the train pull out he was too full for utterance.</p>

<p>"Well, I got it for you," said Stevens; "just got it and that's
all."</p>

<p>"Got what?"</p>

<p>"Got the book&mdash;'Early Christian Martyrs,' and paid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By-the-great-guns!" moaned Watson, as he placed his
hand to his brow and swooned right in the middle of the street.</p>

<h3>MR. POTTS' STORY<br />
BY MAX ADELER</h3>

<p>While I was over at Jersey City, the other day, I called on the
Potts. Mr. Potts is liable to indulge in extravagance in his conversation,
and as Mrs. Potts is an extremely conscientious woman
where matters of fact are concerned, she's obliged to keep her
eye on him. Potts was telling me about an incident that occurred
in the town a few days before, and this is the way he related it:</p>

<p><i>Potts.</i>&mdash;"You see old Bradley over here is perfectly crazy on the
subject of gases, and the atmosphere, and such things&mdash;absolutely
wild; and one day he was disputing with Green about how high
up in the air life could be sustained, and Bradley said an animal
could live about forty million miles above the earth, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Potts.</i>&mdash;"Not forty millions, my dear; only forty miles,
he said."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Forty, was it? Thank you. Well sir, old Green, you
know, said that was ridiculous; and he said he'd bet Bradley a
couple of hundred thousand dollars that life couldn't be sustained
half that way up, and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"William, you are wrong; he offered to bet only fifty
dollars."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Well, anyhow, Bradley took him up quicker'n a wink, and
they agreed to send up a cat in a balloon to decide the bet. So
what does Bradley do but buy a balloon about twice as big as our
barn, and begin to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs P.</i>&mdash;"It was only about ten feet in diameter, Mr. Adeler;
William forgets."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Begin to inflate her. When she was filled, it took eighty
men to hold her, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"Eighty men, Mr. Potts? Why, you know Mr. Bradley
held the balloon himself."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"He did, did he? Oh, very well; what's the odds? And
when everything was ready, they brought out Bradley's tom-cat,
and put it in the basket, and tied it in so that it couldn't jump,
you know. There were about one hundred thousand people looking
on, and, when they let go, you never heard such a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"There were not more than two hundred people there.
I counted them myself."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Oh, don't bother me! I say you never heard such a yell,
as the balloon went scooting up into the sky, pretty near out of
sight. Bradley said she went up about one thousand miles, and&mdash;now
don't interrupt me, Henrietta; I know what the man said&mdash;and
that cat, mind you, a-howling like a hundred fog-horns, so's
you could a' heard her from here to Peru. Well, sir, when she
was up so's she looked as small as a pin-head, something or other
burst. I dunno how it was, but pretty soon down came that
balloon a-flickering toward the earth at the rate of fifty miles
a minute, and old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Potts, you know that the balloon came down as
gently as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Oh, do hush up! Women don't know anything about such
things. And old Bradley, he had a kind of a registering thermometer
fixt in the balloon along with that cat. Some sort of a
patent machine; cost thousands of dollars, and he was expecting
to examine it; and Green had an idea he'd lift out a dead cat and
scoop in the stakes. When all of a sudden, as she came pelting
down, a tornado struck her&mdash;now, Henrietta, what in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>thunder
are you staring at me in that way for? It was a tornado&mdash;a
regular cyclone&mdash;and it struck her and jammed her against the
lightning-rod on the Baptist Church steeple, and there she stuck&mdash;stuck
on that spire, about eight hundred feet up in the air."</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"You may get just as mad as you like, but I am
positively certain that steeple's not an inch over ninety-five feet."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Henrietta, I wish to gracious you'd go up-stairs and look
after the children. Well, about half a minute after she struck
out stept that tom-cat on to the weathercock. It made Green
sick. And just then the hurricane reached the weathercock, and
it began to revolve six hundred or seven hundred times a minute,
the cat howling until you couldn't hear yourself speak&mdash;now, Henrietta,
you've had your put; you keep quiet. That cat stood on
that weathercock about two months&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Potts, that's an awful story; it only happened
last Tuesday."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> (<i>confidentially</i>)&mdash;"Never mind her. And on Sunday the way
that cat carried on and yowled, with its tail pointing due east, was
so awful that they couldn't have church. And Sunday afternoon
the preacher told Bradley if he didn't get that cat down he'd
sue him for a million dollars damages. So Bradley got a gun, and
shot at the cat fourteen hundred times&mdash;now, you didn't count
'em, Henrietta, and I did&mdash;and he banged the top of the steeple
all to splinters, and at last fetched down the cat, shot to rags,
and in her stomach he found the thermometer. She'd ate it on
her way up, and it stood at eleven hundred degrees, so old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;"No thermometer ever stood at such a figure as that."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>)&mdash;"Oh, well, if you think you can tell the story
better than I can, why don't you tell it? You're enough to worry
the life out of a man."</p>

<p>Then Potts slammed the door and went out, and I left. I
don't know whether Bradley got the stakes or not.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sad! I would die if I did not&mdash;&mdash;Who is the tall
lady in black over by the piano?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I do not know. What exquisite lace on her gown!
Do you know that I just simply rave over beautiful lace!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! I care more for it than for jewels, because it&mdash;&mdash;Do
you know the tall, fine-looking man who has just come in?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I have seen him somewhere, and yet I can not&mdash;&mdash;Yes,
thank you, I think I <i>will</i> have a cup of tea. How lovely

<p>"Lovely!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sweet has such exquisite taste!"</p>

<p>"EXQUISITE! I often say&mdash;&mdash;How <i>do</i> you do, my deah?
So glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"Thanks! So glad to meet YOU!"</p>

<p>"So good of you to say so! Quite well, deah?"</p>

<p>"Oh, vulgarly so. I really must <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>say good-by to dear Mrs.
Sweet and go. I must look in at Mrs. Shoddy's for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"So must I. We'll go together."</p>

<p>"HOW LOVELY! Good-by, deah Mrs. Sweet. Have had
<i>such</i> a chawming time!"</p>

<p>"Must you go so soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, really! Such a lovely time!"</p>

<p>"So glad! But it is quite naughty of you to go so soon. So
glad you came!"</p>

<p>"By-by, deah."</p>

<p>"By-by. You will come to see me soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"You MUST. By-by!"</p>

<p>"By-by!"</p>

<p>And as she gathers up her trailing skirts to walk down the steps,
she says: "Thank goodness, that's over!"</p>

you love me, dearie."</p>

<p>"Now, don't be silly, pet. It would be impossible for you to
love me as much as I love you. Of course, I love you best."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't! You love me, I know, but not as much
as I love you."</p>

<p>"Now, Kitty, be reasonable."</p>

<p>"I will if you'll admit that I do love you best."</p>

<p>"How can I admit what isn't true?"</p>

<p>"Well, you might say it was so just to please me."</p>

<span class="i3">It looked extremely rocky for the Mudville nine that day;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The score stood two to four, with but an inning left to play.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So, when Cooney died at second, and Burrows did the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With that hope which springs eternal within the human breast,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">They'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">But Flynn preceded Casey, and likewise so did Blake,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the former was a puddin', and the latter was a fake,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">There was Blakey safe at second, and Flynn a-huggin' third.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Then, from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It rumbled in the mountain-tops, it rattled in the dell;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">There was ease in Casey's manner as he stept into his place;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There was pride in Casey's bearing, and a smile on Casey's face.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.<br /></span>

<h3>A FRIENDLY GAME OF CHECKERS<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>"Now, my dear," said Mr. Italics, as he drew on his slippers
and settled himself for the evening, "if you will get the checker-board,
I'll play you a game&mdash;you're learning so rapidly that it's
really a pleasure to try quits with you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Italics giggled with delight, kissed her husband on the
top of the head and fluttered away to find the board and checkers.
After she had found them, she plumped herself down in a rocking-chair
about a foot and a half lower than his easy-chair and
arranged the apparatus at an angle of fifty degrees, whereupon
Mr. Italics said:</p>

<p>"I think you misapprehend my suggestion. I didn't propose
to go sliding down hill at this season of the year, neither do I
intend to shoot the chutes. My idea was a game of checkers and
if you think those men are going to stand around on a board
tipped up on one end and wait to be moved, you are not familiar
with their habits."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better put a book under it; or if you could
lower your knees a little it would come even."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's your idea, is it? My knees weren't constructed
with special regard to playing checkers. They were put where
they are and fastened and they won't run up and down like a
flag. Do you think I'm the india-rubber man from the circus,
or the cork-legged man from Oskoloosa? If you can't hold up
your side of the board, we won't play."</p>

<p>"Now, dear, it's all right. Let me see, is it your move, or
mine?"</p>

<p>"What are you trying to play? Do you think this is a game
of baseball? Don't you know you've got to move cattecornered?
'Taint your move anyway. Put that back. There. Now I'll
move there."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you're going to jump me and take my man," said
Mrs. Italics, picking up the checker she had moved before and
putting it in her mouth. "If I put it here, you'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"SWALLOW IT, why don't you? If you don't want it taken,
why don't you masticate it? Can't you leave the thing alone
until you get ready to move? Put it down before it chokes you."</p>

<p>"There, dear (<i>swallowing it</i>), I've put it down, but it hurt
my throat."</p>

<p>"What in thunder do you mean by eating up my set of checkers.
When I said 'put it down' I meant put it back on the board. Will
you please play this game instead of masticating it."</p>

<p>"If I put this man there, you'll jump it."</p>

<p>"Just watch and see."</p>

<p>"Now, I'll put this man there,&mdash;no,&mdash;perhaps I had better
move here,&mdash;or I think I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Going to move in six places at once? Think this is the first
of May and that you're looking for a new flat? 'Taint your move
anyway. Now will you please hold the board straight? D'ye
think this is a washboard? Well it isn't and it isn't a teeter-board
either. Now, I'll move into your king row. Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Then do I jump these two men and get a king? Of course,
I do. Crown me! I've got the first king!"</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. I didn't mean that move. If you can't play
checkers without cackling like a hen you'd better stop. I'll take
back that move. Now, so. Now you can move."</p>

<p>"Over here."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span></p>
<p>"Certainly. That's splendid. Now I'll take these two men."</p>

<p>"I didn't see that, I'd rather put it here."</p>

<p>"Too late now. You can't take back a move in this game. You
should study your moves first."</p>

<p>"Well, if I jump here I get another king."</p>

<p>"What do you want to tumble them all over for? Haven't
you got any sense scarcely? You make more fuss over a measly
king than most women over a mouse. Don't you know it's my
move? Give me back those men. Can't you hold the board
straight? What's that? Oh, of course, you know. You know it
all. All you want is a pair of hinges and painted sides to be a
checker-box. If ever I want to play with some good player
I'll put the coal-scuttle on your head and move you around for
a king. There goes the whole business! Now, are you satisfied?
Do you wonder a man won't play checkers with a woman? I'll
throw the measly things out of the window so that I won't waste
any time playing with you again." And Mr. Italics suited the
action to the word. But then Mr. Italics was such an <i>odd type</i>.</p>

<h3>HOW A BACHELOR SEWS ON A BUTTON<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>This is a very laughable piece of pantomime. It is well to have
a small table and a chair, but everything else is left to the
imagination of the audience. The success of the selection depends
upon the varied facial expression and other business. It is advisable
to first practise with a needle and thread so as to get a
correct imitation.</p>

<p>First say to the audience: "Ladies and gentlemen, I shall endeavor
to give you an imitation of how a bachelor sews on a
button." Then seat yourself and take from the table an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>imaginary
spool of thread. Hold it in your left hand and pull out several
lengths with your right hand. Then bite the thread off and put
the spool back on the table. Hold the end of the thread in your
left hand, then wet the first finger and thumb of your right
hand and make the thread into a point. Now start to thread
your needle. The thread refuses to find the eye of the needle
and there is a lot of laughable business here. Change your
position frequently, and at every turn vary the facial expression.
Then blow through the eye of the needle. Just as you think you
have at last put the thread through, the needle is lost and you
look all over for it. After some difficulty you find it on the floor.
Then as you seat yourself again you find the thread in a snarl,
so you take the spool again and pull off several fresh lengths.
Try again to thread the needle and as you get it through the
needle's eye, turn it very carefully around and take hold of the
thread with your teeth, drawing it through slowly with appropriate
facial expression. Now tie a knot in your thread and to make it
secure bite it with your teeth. Reach to the table for your
imaginary button and place it on the <i>inside</i> of your coat. Begin
to sew, with difficulty at first, pulling the thread through at arm's
length. At the third stitch prick your finger and jump as if in
great pain. The thread gradually gets shorter. As you seem
to gain facility you begin to smile. Then wind the thread around
the button, make several short stitches, and bite it off with your
teeth. Now stand and try to button your coat. You first feel
for the button but can not find it. Then you look down at your
coat, but there is no button there. You turn the coat over and
discover that you have sewed the button on the inside. With a
look of anger you pull the button off the coat, throw it violently
on the floor, and exit hastily.</p>

<h3>PRESENTATION OF THE TRUMPET<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>In the days of the old volunteer fire department there existed
in this city a certain hose company noted for the bravery of its
foreman, whose reckless daring in time of danger, coupled with
his pugilistic attainments, had made him a local celebrity.</p>

<p>The members of his company decided to present him with a
handsome silver trumpet, as an expression of their regard and appreciation
of his pluck, courage and fighting qualities. One of
the members was chosen to prepare a fitting speech for the occasion,
and after some weeks of labor announced himself as being
thoroughly prepared for the task.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the foreman, who was supposed to be in
blissful ignorance of all the preparations being made to surprize
him, was let into the "secret" through the kindness of one of the
boys. He recognized this as his supreme opportunity to display
his literary qualifications in the shape of a speech of acceptance.
He secured the services of a literary friend to write a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>glowing
oration, replete with metaphors, similes, and sweet-sounding poetry,
expressing his "unworthiness of the honor," the "deep gratitude
which words failed him to adequately express," etc.</p>

<p>The night in question at last arrived. The building was filled
to overflowing. The band played "See the Conquering Hero
Comes," and the boys gave three hearty cheers and a "tiger" for
the proud foreman.</p>

<p>The chairman advanced to the front, holding the massive trumpet
in one hand, while his other hand grasped convulsively at the
collar of his shirt.</p>

<p>After staring around the room and giving a few preparatory
coughs, he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Foreman, and Members of Hose Company Number 10:
I&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Looks hard at the floor. Begins again with
great determination.</i>) Mr. Foreman, and Members of Hose Company
Number 10: I&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;feel&mdash;I feel a&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Puts one
hand in his pocket and looks very foolish. Begins again, shouting,
and looking very angry.</i>) Mr. Foreman, and Members of
Hose Company Number 10: I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I feel a&mdash;much a pleas&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Word
sticks in his throat. Very angrily, and striding toward
the foreman.</i>) Ah! take your trumpet!"</p>

<p>A look of consternation spread over the faces of the boys at
the failure of their spokesman, and there were many whisperings
of "I told you so!"</p>

<p>It was now the foreman's turn. He drew his hand across his
mouth and began as follows:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, and Members of Hose Company Number 10:
It is&mdash;it is&mdash;it is&mdash;it is with a&mdash;with a&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Looks at ceiling, and
shifts his position uneasily. Begins over again, with a very confident
air.</i>) Mr. Chairman, and Members of Hose Company Number
10: It is with&mdash;with a&mdash;with a&mdash;with a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a heart&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Stops,
stares wildly at the ceiling, floor and company. Begins
over again, very angrily, and with his body in fighting
attitude.</i>) Mr. Chairman, and Members of Hose Company Number
10: I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;it is&mdash;it is with a heart&mdash;with a heart full&mdash;-full&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Stops.
Very loud and violently.</i>) Ah! give us yer
trumpet!"</p>

<h3>THE NEW SCHOOL READER<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>I will now give you a selection from my New School Reader.
It is built upon the lines of the school-books in use in the years
preceding our early childhood. It is one of the selections that
unfortunate boys would render in an heroic attitude, and in stilted,
unnatural tones:</p>

<p>"The October sun was shining down upon an avenue of trees,
and gilding with its golden splendor the chromatic nose of a solitary
horseman, who reigned up his steed at the sight of a small
boy with a school-book on his shoulder. 'Where do you live, my
fine fellow?' said the stranger, in low, pleasing tones. 'In yonder
cottage, near the glen; my widowed mother and her thirteen children
dwell with me,' replied the boy, in a rich, mellow voice.
'And is your father dead?' asked the stranger with a rising
inflection. 'Extremely so,' murmured the lad, 'and that is why
my mother is a widow.' 'And how does your mother gain a livelihood?'
asked the horseman, his voice dropping to a gentle whisper.
'I support the family,' proudly replied George. 'You support
the family? Why, what can such a little fellow as you do?'
'I dig wells during the day, and help my mother at night. I have
a good education and am able to dig wells almost as well as a
man.' 'But you must have to work very hard,' said the stranger,
wiping a tear from his eyebrow. 'Indeed I do, sir, and since my
little sister Ann got married, and brought her husband home to
live with us, I have to work with more assiduity than ever. I am
enabled to barely maintain our family in a precarious manner;
but, oh, sir, should my other sisters marry, I fear that some of
my brothers-in-law would have to suffer.' 'My boy,' asked the
solitary horseman, looking at the youth proudly, 'what would you
say if I told you your father was not dead?' 'Sir,' replied the boy
respectfully, 'I am too polite to tell you what I would say,&mdash;besides
you are much larger than I am.' 'But, my brave lad,'
said the man in low, musical tones, 'do you not recognize your
parent on your father's side?&mdash;do you not know me, Georgie? O
George!' 'I must say,' replied George, 'that you have the advantage
of me. While I may have met you before, I can not at this
moment place you, sir!' At this the stranger opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span> his valise
and took therefrom a large-sized strawberry mark, which he placed
on his right arm. Immediately the boy recognized him as his
long-lost parent, and he, drawing the lad to his bosom, ejaculated,
'O my son, my son!' 'But how did you escape, father?' said the
boy through his tears, in a voice broken by emotion. 'We were
far away at sea,' said the heartbroken man. 'The winds howled
and the waves threatened to engulf our frail bark. When everybody
was lost, the rest of the crew turned and sprang into the
foaming billows and swam several miles. At last I felt my feet
touch something <i>hard</i>,&mdash;it was Jersey City!'"</p>

<h3>MY DOUBLE, AND HOW HE UNDID ME<br />
BY EDWARD EVERETT HALE</h3>

<p>I am, or rather, was a minister, and was settled in an active,
wide-awake town with a bright parish and a charming young
wife. At first it was all delightful, but as my duties increased
I found myself leading a double life&mdash;one for my parish, whom
I loved, and the other for a vague public, for whom I did not
care two straws. It was then that on my wife's suggestion I
looked for a double&mdash;some one who would pass for me and fill
the many engagements I wanted to shirk. I found him. When
he was discovered his name was Dennis Shea, and he was not
shaved, had no spectacles, and his style of dress was not at all
like mine; but these difficulties were soon surmounted, for, by
application to the Judge of Probate, his name was soon changed
to Frederick Ingham&mdash;my name. As for appearance, he was so
much like me that by the united efforts of Polly and myself and
a tailor he was made to look the exact image of me. Then in
four successive afternoons I taught him four speeches, which
were to be his stock in trade:</p>

<p>No. 1&mdash;"Very well, thank you; and you?" (This for an
answer to casual salutations.)</p>

<p>No. 2&mdash;"I am very glad you liked it." (This in response to
a compliment on a sermon.)</p>

<p>No. 3&mdash;"There has been so much said, and on the whole so
well said, that I will not occupy the time." (This for public
meetings when called to speak.)</p>

<p>No. 4&mdash;"I agree in general with my friend on the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
of the room." (This when asked for an opinion of his own.)</p>

<p>Thus equipped, my double attended a number of conventions
and meetings which I was too busy to notice and was very successful.
He gained a good reputation for me, and people began to
say I was less exclusive than I used to be, and that I was more
punctual, less talkative, etc. His success was so great that one
evening I risked him at a reception. I could ill afford the time
to go, and so I sent him with Polly, who kept her eye on him,
and afterward told me about it. He had to take a very talkative
lady&mdash;Mrs. Jeffries&mdash;down to supper, and at sight of the eatables
he became a little excited, and attempted one of his speeches to
the lady. He tried the shortest one in his most gallant manner:
"Very well, thank you; and you?" Polly, who stood near his
chair, was much frightened, as this speech had no connection
with anything that had been said, but Mrs. Jeffries was so much
engrossed with her own talking that she noticed nothing. She
rattled on so busily that Dennis was not obliged to say anything
more until the eating was over, when he said, to fill up a pause:
"There has been so much said, and on the whole so well said,
that I will not occupy the time." This again frightened Polly,
but she managed to get him away before he had done anything
serious.</p>

<p>After this my double relieved me in so many ways that I grew
quite light-hearted. That happy year I began to know my wife
by sight. We saw each other sometimes, and how delightful it
was! But all this could not last; and at length poor Dennis,
my double, undid me!</p>

<p>There was some ridiculous new movement on foot to organize
some kind of a society, and there was to be a public meeting.
Of course I was asked to attend and to speak. After much urging
I consented to go and sit on the platform, upon condition that
I would not be called upon to make a speech. This was agreed
upon, and I went&mdash;that is, Dennis went, having been told to say
nothing on any subject. He sat resplendent on the platform,
and kept his peace during the preliminary exercises, which were
rather dry. Governor Blake called the meeting to order, but
as he really did not know what the object of the gathering <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>was,
he said that there were other gentlemen present who could entertain
them better than he. Then there followed an awkward
scene, for nobody wanted to speak, and every one that was
called upon was either absent or unprepared; and finally a
wretched boy in the gallery called out, "Ingham! Ingham!" The
governor thought I would respond, and as nothing had been said
so far, he ventured to ask me, saying: "Our friend, Mr. Ingham,
is always prepared, and tho we had not relied upon him, he
will say a word perhaps." Applause followed, which turned
Dennis' head. He rose and tried speech No. 3: "There has been
so much said, and on the whole so well said, that I will not longer
occupy the time!"</p>

<p>Then he sat down, looking for his hat&mdash;for things seemed
squally. But the people cried, "Go on! Go on!" and some applauded.
Dennis still confused, but flattered by the applause,
rose again, and this time tried No. 2: "I am very glad you like
it." Which, alas! should only be said when complimented on a
sermon. My best friends stared, and people who didn't know me
yelled with delight. A boy in the gallery cried out: "It's all
a humbug!" just as Dennis, waving his hand, commanded silence,
and tried No. 4: "I agree in general with my friend on the other
side of the room." The poor governor, doubting his senses,
crossed to stop him, but too late. The same gallery boy shouted:
"How's your mother?" And Dennis, completely lost, tried as
his last shot No. 1: "Very well, thank you; and you?" The
audience rose in a whirl of excitement. Some other impertinence
from the gallery was aimed at Dennis; he broke all restraint and
to finish undoing me, he called out: "Any wan o' ye blatherin'
rascals that wants to fight, can come down an' I'll take any five
o' yez, single-handed; ye're all dogs and cowards! Sure an'
I've said all his riverance an' the mistress bade me say!"</p>

<p>That was all; my double had undone me.</p>

<h3>AN INTRODUCTION<br />
BY MARK TWAIN</h3>

<p>"Ladies&mdash;and&mdash;gentlemen:&mdash;By&mdash;the request of the&mdash;Chairman
of the&mdash;Com-mit-tee&mdash;I beg leave to&mdash;introduce&mdash;to you&mdash;the
reader of the evening&mdash;a gentleman whose great learning&mdash;whose
historical ac-curacy&mdash;whose devotion&mdash;to science&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;whose
veneration for the truth&mdash;are only equaled by his
high moral character&mdash;and&mdash;his&mdash;majestic presence. I allude&mdash;in
these vague general terms&mdash;to my-self. I&mdash;am a little opposed
to the custom of ceremoniously introducing a reader to the audience,
because it seems&mdash;unnecessary&mdash;where the man has been
properly advertised! But as&mdash;it is&mdash;the custom&mdash;I prefer to
make it myself&mdash;in my own case&mdash;and then I can rely on getting
in&mdash;all the facts! I never had but one introduction&mdash;that seemed
to me just the thing&mdash;and the gentleman was not acquainted with
me, and there was no nonsense. Ladies and gentlemen, I shall
waste no time in this introduction. I know of only two facts
about this man: first, he&mdash;has never been in the state prison;
and second, I can't&mdash;imagine why."</p>


<h3>THE HARP OF A THOUSAND STRINGS<br />
A Hard-shell Baptist Sermon<br />
BY JOSHUA S. MORRIS</h3>

<p>(This characteristic effusion first appeared in a New Orleans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
paper. The sermon is supposed to have been preached at a
village on the bank of the Mississippi River, whither the volunteer
parson had brought his flatboat for the purpose of trade.)</p>

<p>I may say to you, my brethring, that I am not an edicated
man, an' I am not one of them as beleeves that edication is
necessary for a Gospel minister, for I beleeve the Lord edicates
his preachers jest as He wants 'em to be edicated; an' altho I say
it that oughtn't to say it, yet in the State of Indianny, whar I
live, thar's no man as gits bigger congregations nor what I gits.</p>

<p>Thar may be some here to-day, my brethring, as don't know
what persuasion I am uv. Well, I must say to yu, my brethring,
that I'm a Hard-shell Baptist. Thar's some folks as don't like
the Hard-shell Baptists, but I'd rather have a hard shell as no
shell at all. You see me here to-day, my brethring, drest up in
fine clothes; you mout think I was proud, but I am not proud,
my brethring; and altho I've been a preacher of the Gospel for
twenty years, an' altho I'm capting of the flatboat that lies at
your landing, I'm not proud, my brethring.</p>

<p>I am not gwine to tell edzactly whar my tex may be found;
suffice to say, it's in the leds of the Bible, and you'll find it
somewhar between the fust chapter of the book of Generations
and the last chapter of the book of Revolutions; and ef you'll go
and sarch the Scriptures, you'll not only find my tex thar, but
a great many other texes as will do you good to read; and my
tex, when you shall find it, you shall find it to read thus: "And
he played on a harp uv a thousand strings, sperits uv jest men
made perfeck."</p>

<p>My tex, my brethring, leads me to speak of sperits. Now,
thar's a great many kinds of sperits in the world. In the fust
place, thar's the sperits as some folks call ghosts; and thar's
the sperits of turpentine; and thar's the sperits as some folks
call liquor, an' I've got as good an artikel of them kind of sperits
on my flatboat as ever was fotch down the Mississippi River.
But thar's a great many other kinds of sperits, for the tex says,
"He played on a harp uv a t-h-o-u-s-and strings, sperits uv jest
men made perfeck."</p>

<p>But I tell you the kind uv sperits as is meant in the tex is
FIRE. That's the kind uv sperits as is meant in the tex, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
brethring. Now, thar's a great many kinds uv fire in the world.
In the fust place, there's the common sort of fire you light your
cigars or pipe with; and then thar's foxfire and camphire, fire
before you're ready, and fire and fall back, and many other kinds
of fire&mdash;for the tex say, "He played on a harp uv a <i>thous</i>and
strings, sperits uv jest men made perfeck."</p>

<p>But I'll tell you the kind of fire as is meant in the tex, my
brethring: its HELL-FIRE! An' that's the kind uv fire as
a great many uv you'll come to, ef you don't do better nor what
you have been doin'&mdash;for "He played on a harp uv a <i>thous</i>and
strings, sperits uv jest men made perfeck."</p>

<p>Now, the different sorts of fire in the world may be likened
onto the different persuasions of Christians in the world. In
the fust place, we have the Piscapalions, an' they are a high-sailin'
and highfalutin' set; and they may be likened unto a
turkey buzzard that flies up in the air, and he goes up, and up,
and up, till he looks no bigger than your finger-nail, and the
fust thing you know, he cums down, and down, and down, and
is a-fillin' himself on the carkiss of a dead hoss by the side of the
road&mdash;and "He played on a harp uv a <i>thous</i>and strings, sperits uv
jest men made perfeck."</p>

<p>And then thar's the Methodis, and they may be likened unto
the squirril runnin' up into a tree, for the Methodis beleeves in
gwine on from one degree of grace to another, and finally on to
perfection; and the squirril goes up and up, and up and up, and
he jumps from limb to limb, and branch to branch, and the fust
thing you know he falls, and down he cums kerflumix; and that's
like the Methodis, for they is allers fallin' from grace, ah!&mdash;and
"He played on a harp uv a <i>thous</i>and strings, sperits uv jest
men made perfeck."</p>

<p>And then, my brethring, thar's the Baptists, ah! and they
have been likened unto a 'possum on a 'simmon tree, and thunders
may roll and the earth may quake, but that 'possum clings thar
still, sh! and you may shake one foot loose, and the other's thar,
and you make shake all feet loose, and he laps his tail around
the limb, and clings, and he clings furever&mdash;for "He played on
a harp uv a <i>thous</i>and strings, sperits uv jest men made perfeck."</p>

<h3>THE SHIP OF FAITH<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>A certain colored brother had been holding forth to his little
flock upon the ever-fruitful topic of <i>Faith</i>, and he closed his exhortation
about as follows:</p>

<p>"My bruddren, ef yous gwine to git saved, you got to git on
board de Ship ob Faith. I tell you, my bruddren, dere ain't no
odder way. Dere ain't no gitten up de back stairs, nor goin'
'cross lots; you can't do dat away, my bruddren, you got to git
on board de Ship ob Faith. Once 'pon a time dere was a lot ob
colored people, an' dey was all gwine to de promised land. Well,
dey knowed dere w'an't no odder way for 'em to do but to git
on board de Ship ob Faith. So dey all went down an' got on
board, de ole granfaders, an' de ole granmudders, an' de pickaninnies,
an' all de res' of 'em. Dey all got on board 'ceptin' one
mons'us big feller, he said he's gwine to swim, he was. 'W'y!' dey
said, 'you can't swim so fur like dat. It am a powerful long <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>way
to de promised land!' He said: 'I kin swim anywhur, I kin. I
git board no boat, no, 'deed!' Well, my bruddren, all dey could
say to dat poor disluded man dey couldn't git him on board de
Ship of Faith, so dey started off. De day was fair, de win'
right; de sun shinin' and ev'ryt'ing b'utiful, an' dis big feller he
pull off his close and plunge in de water. Well, he war a powerful
swimmer, dat man, 'deed he war; he war dat powerful he kep'
right 'long side de boat all de time; he kep' a hollerin' out to de
people on de boat, sayin': 'What you doin' dere, you folks, brilin'
away in de sun; you better come down heah in de water, nice an'
cool down here.' But dey said: 'Man alive, you better come up
here in dis boat while you got a chance.' But he said: 'No, indeedy!
I git aboard no boat; I'm havin' plenty fun in de water.'
Well, bimeby, my bruddren, what you tink dat pore man seen?
A <i>horrible, awful shark</i>, my bruddren; mouf wide opne, teef
more'n a foot long, ready to chaw dat pore man all up de minute
he catch him. Well, when he seen dat shark he begun to git
awful scared, an' he holler out to de folks on board de ship:
'Take me on board, take me on board, quick!' But dey said:
'No, indeed; you wouldn't come up here before, you swim now!'</p>

<p>"He look over his shoulder an' he seen dat shark a-comin' an'
he let hisself out. Fust it was de man an' den it was de shark,
an' den it was de man again, dat away, my bruddren, <i>plum to de
promised land</i>. Dat am de blessed troof I'm a-tellin' you dis
minute. But what do you t'ink was a-waitin' for him on de odder
shore when he got dere? A <i>horrible, awful lion</i>, my bruddren,
was a-stan'in' dere on de shore, a-lashin' his sides wid his tail,
an' a-roarin' away fit to devour dat poor nigger de minit he git
on de shore.</p>

<p>"Well, he <i>war</i> powerful scared den, he don't know what he
gwine to do. If he stay in de water de shark eat him up; if he
go on shore de lion eat him up; he dunno what to do. But he
put his trust in de Lord, an' went for de shore. Dat lion he give
a fearful roar an' bound for him; but, my bruddren, as sure as
you live an' breeve, dat horrible, awful lion he jump clean ober
dat pore feller's head into de water; an' <i>de shark eat de lion</i>.
But, my bruddren, don't you put your trust in no such circumstance;
dat pore man he done git saved, but I tell you <i>de Lord
ain't a-gwine to furnish a lion fo' every nigger</i>!"</p>

<p>Early one moonlight morning, in the city of London, a man was
vainly trying to find his home, but being unable to locate it he
called upon the services of a passer-by.</p>

<p>"Hey! M-m-mister (hic), will you take me to twenty-two?"</p>

<p>"Number twenty&mdash;Why you are standing right in front of it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no you d-d-don't,&mdash;that's two-two, two-two!"</p>

<p>"Why, no, it's twenty-two."</p>

<p>"Say, you can't fool me. 'Nuther fellow tried to d-d-do that.
He-he-he told me the other side of the street was (hic) on this
side,&mdash;an' 'tisn't,&mdash;s-sit's over there. Please t-t-take me (hic) to
twenty-two, will you?"</p>

<p>The man walked him around the block and back again.</p>

<p>"Now, then, get out your key. I must be going."</p>

<p>"Say, it was m-m-mighty (hic) jolly of you to bring me all this
l-l-long way ho-ho-home, old chap!"</p>

<p>"That's all right. Now get your key,&mdash;hurry up."</p>

<p>"I'm ever so much obliged to you for bringing me all this
long way ho-ho-home."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I must go now. Good-night."</p>

<p>The man had walked but a little distance when he heard his
friend trying to whistle to him.</p>

<p>"Hey! (<i>Tries to whistle</i>). C-co-come here, I want ter speak
to you. Now d-d-don't get mad (hic), old chap, it's important."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I just want to (hic) tell you how much obliged I'm to you
for bringing me all this long way home."</p>

<p>"You had better go to bed now, so good-night."</p>

<p>"Hold up, old chap, you're a-a-a&mdash;would you mind telling
me what your name is?"</p>

<p>Here the clock in St. Paul's struck two.</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;is St. Paul."</p>

<p>"Good enough, Miss Saint 'All. Much obliged to you for bring&mdash;me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, good-night."</p>

<h3>AN OPPORTUNITY<br />

<p>I dropt into the post-office this morning for my mail, and just
inside the door I found a little boy crying very bitterly. Naturally
I asked him the cause of his trouble, and lifting his tear-stained
face to mine he said:</p>

<p>"I had two quarters, and a feller come along just now and
took one away from me."</p>

<p>"What!" said I, "right here in the post-office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you tell some one?"</p>

<p>"I did; I hollered, 'Help! help!'" (<i>Said very weakly.</i>)</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "is that as loud as you can holler?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<h3>GAPE-SEED<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>A farmer, walking the streets of one of our big cities, looked
through a window at a lot of men writing very rapidly on typewriters;
and as he stood at the door with his mouth open, one
of the men called out to him, "Do you wish to buy some gape-seed?"
Passing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>on a short distance, he asked a man what the
business was of the men he had just seen in the office he had
passed. He was told that they wrote letters dictated by others,
and transcribed all sorts of documents. The farmer returned
to the office, and inquired if one of the men would write a letter
for him, and was answered in the affirmative. He asked the price,
and was told one dollar. After considerable talk, the bargain
was made; one of the conditions being that the scribe should
write just what the farmer told him to, or he should receive no
pay. The man said he was ready, and the farmer dictated as
follows:</p>

<p>"Dear wife," and then asked, "Have you got that down?"</p>

<p>"Yes; <i>go on</i>."</p>

<p>"I went for a ride the other day&mdash;have you got that down?"</p>

<p>"Yes; <i>go on, go on</i>."</p>

<p>"And I harnessed up the old mare into the wagon&mdash;have you
got that down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, long ago; <i>go on</i>."</p>

<p>"Why, how fast you write!&mdash;And I got into the wagon, and
sat down, and drew up the reins, and took the whip in my right
hand&mdash;have you got that down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, long ago; <i>go on</i>."</p>

<p>"Dear me, how fast you write! I never saw your equal.&mdash;And
I said to the old mare, '<i>Go 'long</i>,' and I jerked the reins
pretty hard&mdash;have you got that down?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I am impatiently waiting for more. I wish you
wouldn't bother me with so many foolish questions. Go on with
your letter."</p>

<p>"Well, the old mare wouldn't stir out of her tracks, and I
hollered, '<i>Go 'long, you old jade! go 'long</i>'&mdash;have you got that
down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, <i>you pestiferous fellow; go on</i>."</p>

<p>"And I licked her, and licked her, and licked her&mdash;&mdash;" (<i>continuing
to repeat these words as rapidly as possible</i>).</p>

<p>"Hold on there! I have written two pages of 'licked her,'
and I want the rest of the letter."</p>

<p>"Well, and she kicked, and she kicked, and she kicked&mdash;&mdash;" (<i>continuing
to repeat these words with great rapidity</i>).</p>

<p>"Do go on with your letter; I have several pages of 'she
kicked.'"</p>

<p>(<i>The farmer clucks as in urging horses to move, and continues
the clucking noise with rapid repetition for some time.</i>)</p>

<p>The scribe jumps up from the typewriter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>
<p>"<i>Write it down! write it down!</i>"</p>

<p>"I can't!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, I won't pay you."</p>

<p>(<i>The scribe, gathering up his papers.</i>) "What shall I do with
all these sheets upon which I have written your nonsense?"</p>

<p>"You might use them in doing up your <i>gape-seed</i>! Good-day!"</p>

<h3>THE CANDIDATE<br />
BY BILL NYE</h3>

<p>The heat and the venom of each political campaign bring back
to my mind with wonderful clearness the bitter and acrimonious
war, and the savage factional fight, which characterized my own
legislative candidacy in what was called the Prairie Dog District
of Wyoming, about ten years ago.</p>

<p>I hesitated about accepting the nomination because I knew that
vituperation would get up on its hind feet and annoy me greatly,
and, indeed, this turned out to be the case.</p>

<p>In due time I was nominated, and one evening my heart swelled
when I heard a campaign band coming up the street, trying to
see how little it could play and still draw its salary. The band
was followed by men with torches, and speakers in carriages.
A messenger was sent into the house to tell me that I was about
to be waited upon by my old friends and neighbors, who desired
to deliver to me their hearty endorsement, and a large willow-covered
two-gallon Godspeed as a mark of esteem.</p>

<p>The spokesman, as soon as I had stept out on my veranda,
mounted the improvised platform previously erected, and after
a short and debilitated solo and chorus by the band, said as
follows, as near as I can now recall his words:</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Nye</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir:&mdash;We have read with pain the open and venomous attacks
of the foul and putrid press of our town, and come here to-night
to vindicate by our presence your utter innocence <i>as</i> a man,
<i>as</i> a fellow citizen, <i>as</i> a neighbor, <i>as</i> a father, mother, brother
or sister.</p>

<p>"No one could look down into your open face, and deep,
earnest lungs, and then doubt you <i>as</i> a man, <i>as</i> a fellow citizen,
<i>as</i> a neighbor, <i>as</i> a father, mother, brother, or sister. You came
to us a poor man, and staked your all on the growth of this town.
We like you because you are still poor. You can not be too
poor to suit us. It shows that you are not corrupt.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nye, on behalf of this vast assemblage (<i>tremulo</i>), I am
glad that you are POOR!!!"</p>

<p>Mr. Limberquid then said:</p>

<p>"Sir:&mdash;What do we care for the vilifications of the press&mdash;a
press hired, venial, corrupt, reeking in filth and oozy with the
slime of its own impaired circulation, snapping at the heels of its
superiors, and steeped in the reeking poison and pollution of its
own shop-worn and unmarketable opinions?</p>

<p>"What do we care that homely men grudge our candidate his
symmetry of form and graceful, upholstered carriage? What do
we care that calumny crawls out of its hole, calumniates him a
couple of times and then goes back?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span></p>
<p>"We like him for the poverty he has made. Our idea in running
him for the Legislature is to give him a chance to accumulate
poverty, and have some saved up for a rainy day."</p>

<p>Several people wept here, and wiped their eyes on their alabaster
hands. The band then played, "See the Conquering Hero
Comes," and yielding to the pressing demands of the populi, I
made a few irrelevant, but low, passionate remarks, as follows:</p>

<p>"Fellow Citizens and Members of the Band:&mdash;We are not here,
as I understand it, solely to tickle our palates with the twisted
doughnuts of our pampered and sin-curst civilization, but to
unite and give our pledges once more to the support of the best
men. In this teacup of foaming and impervious cider from the
Valley of the Jordan I drink to the success of the best men.
Fellow citizens and members of the band, we owe our fealty to
the old party. Let us cling to the old party as long as there
is any juice in it and vote for its candidates. Let us give our
suffrages to men of advanced thought who are loyal to their
party but poor. Gentlemen, I am what would be called a poor
but brainy man. When I am not otherwise engaged you will
always find me engaged in thought. I love the excitement of
following an idea and chasing it up a tree. It is a great pleasure
for me to pursue the red-hot trail of a thought or the intellectual
spoor of an idea. But I do not allow this habit to interfere with
politics. Politics and thought are radically different. Why should
man think himself weak on these political matters when there
are men who have made it their business and life study to do the
thinking for the masses?</p>

<p>"This is my platform. I believe that a candidate should be
poor; that he should be a thinker on other matters, but leave
political matters and nominations to professional political ganglia
and molders of primaries who have given their lives and the
inner coating of their stomachs to the advancement of political
methods by which the old, cumbersome and dangerous custom of
defending our institutions with drawn swords may be superseded
by the modern and more attractive method of doing so with
overdrawn salaries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span></p>
<p>"Fellow Citizens and Members of the Band:&mdash;In closing let me
say that you have seen me placed in the trying position of postmaster
for the past year. For that length of time I have stood
between you and the government at Washington. I have assisted
in upholding the strong arm of the government, and yet I have
not allowed it to crush you. No man here to-night can say that
I have ever, by word or deed, revealed outside the office the contents
of a postal card addrest to a member of my own party or
held back or obstructed the progress of new and startling seeds
sent by our representative from the Agricultural Department.
I am in favor of a full and free interchange of interstate red-eyed
and pale beans, and I favor the early advancement and
earnest recognition of the merits of the highly offensive partizan.
I thank you, neighbors and band (<i>husky and pianissimo</i>), for
this gratifying little demonstration. Words seem empty and
unavailing at this time. Will you not accept the hospitality of
my home? Neighbors, you are welcome to these halls. Come in
and look at the family album."</p>


<h3>ONE AFTERNOON<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>The events narrated in the following story take place about the
middle of the twentieth century. At that date the institution
known as the department store had reached its full development.
There was not a single article of any kind that could not be
purchased at one of these mammoth emporiums. It is well to
bear this fact in mind, for the whole action of this story takes
place under the roof of Sniggle Scooper's Department Store.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene the First.</span> When Charlie Hussel entered Sniggle
Scooper's refreshment department on that beautiful summer afternoon,
he had no more idea of getting married than most millionaires
have of paying full taxes on all their property. Charlie
sat down at the counter and ordered a plain soda. He had
been at the club the night before and his nerves were somewhat
unstrung. While waiting for his soda he noticed a young lady
by his side toying with an ice cream soda marked down from
seven cents to four and a half. She was as fair as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span> poet's dream
and the young man's heart beat tumultuously within him as he
gazed at her. He longed for an opportunity of speaking to her
and at last it came. She dropt her purse,&mdash;whether by accident
I leave you to conjecture. Picking up the pocketbook our
hero handed it to the young lady with a bow. She took the pocketbook,
but returned the bow.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she murmured; "you are very kind."</p>

<p>"No," said he, "I am not kind. I'm a selfish brute!"</p>

<p>"Then why did you trouble yourself to pick up my purse?"</p>

<p>"Because, to tell the truth, I wanted to hear your voice."</p>

<p>"And now that you have heard it?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could hear it always. Consent to be my wife. You
love me, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes! What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Charlie Hussel,&mdash;and yours, dear?"</p>

<p>"Mildred Uptodate. Now, Charlie, you must ask father's consent."</p>

<p>"All right, Mabel. There is a telephone on the next floor.
Come along and I'll ask him."</p>

<p>They ascended by the escalator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene the Second.</span> Mr. Uptodate readily gave his consent,
for he knew of Charlie Hussel in a business way.</p>

<p>"Now, Mildred, let us set the time for the wedding. It is now
five minutes after one. Suppose we say four o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no, I can't possibly get ready before to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"Of course you can. Why, you can get everything you need
right here in this store."</p>

<p>"Well, Charlie, if you insist, I suppose I must yield. But it
seems a terribly short engagement."</p>

<p>"Yes, sweetheart, but then our married life will be so much
longer. Run along, now, darling, and get your wedding-gown,
while I get a suit of clothes and attend to the license. Meet me
in the chapel on the top floor at half past four sharp."</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the happy couple were made one by the
department store <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>clergyman. A few minutes later they were
seated in the café enjoying their wedding dinner. How happy
they were as they planned for the future!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene the Third.</span> Dinner was over and the happy pair went
hand-in-hand toward the transportation department to arrange
for their wedding tour. As they passed a bargain counter, the
bride exclaimed rapturously:</p>

<p>"O Charlie, I see some lovely bargains over there. Do let me
have two dollars."</p>

<p>A moment later the proud husband was watching his wife
as with the ease born of long practise she fought her way through
the crowd and reached the counter. After a little while she
returned waving triumphantly a folded paper, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Wasn't I lucky? I got the last one they had."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? It's a divorce!"</p>

<p>The young man grew pale.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, "you loved me."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I love you, but I simply couldn't resist such
a bargain as that."</p>

<p>She pointed to a sign. Charlie looked at it and read:</p>

<h3>A TWILIGHT IDYL<br />
BY ROBERT J. BURDETTE</h3>

<p>One summer evening, Mr. Ellis Henderson, a popular young
man, went out walking with two of the sweetest girls in town.
Mr. Henderson wore a little straw hat with a navy blue band,
a cutaway coat, a pair of white trousers, a white vest, a buttonhole
bouquet, and fifteen cents. The evening was very hot, and as
they walked, they talked about the baseball match, the weather,
and sunstrokes. By and by one of the young ladies gave a delicate
little shriek.</p>

<p>"OO-oo! What a funny sign!"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;yes," said Mr. Henderson, in troubled tones, looking
gently but resolutely at the wrong side of the street.</p>

<p>"How funny it is spelled; see, Ethel."</p>

<p>"Why," said Ethel, "it is spelled correctly. Isn't it, Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>Henderson?"</p>

<p>"Hy&mdash;why&mdash;aw&mdash;why, yes, to be sure," said Mr. Henderson,
staring at a window full of house-plants.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Henderson," said Elfrida, "how can you say so?
Just see, 'i&mdash;c&mdash;e, ice, c&mdash;r double e&mdash;m, creem'; that's not the
way to spell cream."</p>

<p>And Mr. Henderson, who was praying harder than he ever
prayed before that an earthquake might come along and swallow
up either himself or all the ice-cream parlors in the United States,
looked up at the chimney of the house and said:</p>

<p>"That? Oh, yes, yes; of course, why certainly. How very
much cooler it has grown within the past few minutes. That cool
wave from Manitoba is nearing us once more."</p>

<p>He took out his handkerchief and swabbed a face that would
scorch an iceberg brown in ten minutes.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Mr. Henderson," asked Ethel, "that soda fountains
sometimes explode?"</p>

<p>"Oh, frequently," said he, "and they scatter death and destruction
everywhere. In some of our Eastern cities they have been
abolished by law,&mdash;and they ought to do the same thing here!
Why, in New York, all the soda fountains have been removed far
outside the city limits and are now located side by side with powder
houses."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of them," said Ethel, "and I don't believe they
are a bit dangerous."</p>

<p>"Nor I," echoed Elfrida, "I would not be afraid to walk up
to one and stand by it all day. Why are you so afraid of them,
Mr. Henderson?"</p>

<p>"Because once I had a fair, sweet young sister blown to pieces
by one of those terrible engines of destruction while she was
drinking at it, and I can not look at one without growing faint."</p>

<p>"How do they make soda water, Mr. Henderson?"</p>

<p>He was about to reply that it was composed chiefly of dirt and
poison, when Ethel read aloud four ice-cream signs, and said,
"How comfortable and happy all those people look in there."</p>

<p>Then young Mr. Henderson, who had been clawing at his hair,
and tearing off his necktie <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>and collar, and pawing the air, shouted
in tones of wild frenzy:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes! Come in; come in and gorge yourselves.
Everybody come in and eat up a whole week's salary in fifteen
minutes. Set 'em up! Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, pineapple,
raspberry, lemon, peach, apricot, tutti frutti, nesselrode pudding,
water-ice, cake and sherbet. Set 'em up! The treat's on me. Oh,
yes, I can stand it. Ha, ha! I'm Astorbilt in disguise. Oh, yes;
it doesn't cost anything to take an evening walk! Put out your
frozen pudding! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>They carried him home to his boarding house, and put him to
bed, and sent for his physician. He is not yet out of danger,
but will recover. The exact trouble is a mystery to the doctor,
but he thinks it must be hydrosodia, as the sight of a piece of ice
throws the patient into the wildest and most furious paroxysms.</p>



<h3>LAVERY'S HENS<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>Michael Lavery, a thrifty Irishman, lived in a small cottage,
on Devarsey Street, South Side, Chicago. It had no yard in
front, and the rear was ditto. It had a cellar, however, and it
occurred to Lavery that he might make something out of it by
using it as a hen-house; but one cold night, during the following
winter, the water-pipes burst, flooded the cellar, and drowned
the chickens. Friends of Lavery told him the city would make
good his loss if he made proper application. So Mr. Lavery went
down to the city hall, and entering the room of the clerk, said:</p>

<p>"Good marnin'. Me name is Michael Lavery, and I live in Devarsey
Street, on the South Side, and I kape chickens in me cellar,

<p>"Well, you step into the next room and see the mayor. You
will find him at his desk; tell him what you want."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, I will." (<i>Exit Lavery to next room.</i>)</p>

<p>"Good marnin'. Me name is Michael Lavery, and I live in Devarsey

to say, I don't agree that they are very nearly as good as we are.
I know (<i>again he is hit in the back</i>) there are few drink the health
of the army and navy,&mdash;I mean ladies. Shakespeare says that
'when a woman' (<i>hit again</i>)&mdash;I had it just now. Shakespeare
says, 'When a woman,'&mdash;oh, yes, the immortal bard says, 'We
won't go home till morning!'" (<i>Sits down in great confusion.</i>)</p>


<h3>REHEARSING FOR PRIVATE THEATRICALS<br />
BY STANLEY HUNTLEY</h3>

<p>"Now, my dear," said Mr. Spoopendyke, opening the book and
assuming the correct dramatic scowl&mdash;"now my dear, we'll rehearse
our parts for Specklewottle's theatricals. I'm to be Hamlet and
you're to be the queen, and we want this thing to go off about
right. The hardest part we have to play together is where I accuse
you of poisoning my father, and we'd better try that until
we get it perfect. I'll commence:</p>

<p>"Now, mother, what's the matter?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span></p>
<p>"Well, I was thinking whether I had better wear my black
silk or my maroon suit. Do queens wear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to tell me what pack of cards you
got that idea of a queen from? Do you suppose the queen sent
for Hamlet to get his opinion about bargains in dry-goods?
When I say that you must say, 'Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended!'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand, I thought you asked me what I was thinking
about. I didn't know you had commenced to play. Try it
again."</p>

<p>"Well you be careful this time, this is a play, this is. Think
you know the difference between a play and a bankrupt sale?
Know the distinction between a play and a millinery-shop opening?
Now, I'll begin again and you try to do it decently."</p>

<p>"Now, mother, what's the matter!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter now; go on, dear. I understand it
now."</p>

<p>"Say it, can't ye! Haven't ye studied this business? Don't ye
know your part?"</p>

<p>"What shall I say, dear?"</p>

<p>"Say! Sing a hymn! If you don't know your part, get off
a psalm! Didn't I tell you what to say? Look here. Have you
ever read this play? Have you conceived any kind of a notion
of what it's all about?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you come in and stab Mr. Specklewottle behind the
ears and I scream. Isn't that right, dear?"</p>

<p>"Hear her! Stab Specklewottle behind the ears! That is all
right; now you scream! Scream, why don't you? You know
so much about your measly part, why don't you play it?"</p>

<p>"We-e-e-e-e! I knew I could do it right as soon as you showed
me how. Will that do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was queenly! Just do that again! Four of those
dramatic efforts will make this play the greatest of modern entertainments!
Do it once more!"</p>

<p>"It hurts my throat. Can't we make it do with one scream,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Spoopendyke, there's been some mistake made in this
thing. You should have been cast for Ophelia. That was the
part intended for you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span></p>
<p>"I would just as soon play it. What does he do?"</p>

<p>"He was an idiot from his birth and afterward went crazy.
That was the part for you."</p>

<p>"Then I'd rather be queen. Now, dear, let's commence all over
and I'll do it right this time."</p>

<p>"You can't do it worse. I'll try it once more, just to see
what kind of foolishness you can work off."</p>

<p>"Now, mother, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"We-e-e-e, Hamlet, oh, Hamlet! We-e-e-e-e!"</p>

<p>"Turn it off! Be quick and break off the end! What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"We-e-e-e-e!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"We-e-e-e-e-e! My dear, you are just splendid as Hamlet.
You should have been an actor."</p>

<p>"Will ye ever shut up? Who ever told ye to yell like that?
Don't ye know anything at all scarcely? Think Hamlet's a
lunatic asylum? Got some kind of a notion that the queen's
a fog-horn? Where'd ye get your idea of this thing, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I did just as you told me, dear. You said I was to scream
when you asked me what the matter was. Didn't I do it right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was right! You struck the keynote of high art both
times! With that yell and your knowledge of the text all you
want now is a fire and a free list to be a theater with a restaurant
attachment! Such talent as that can't be wasted on any cheap
Shakespeare plays while I've got the money and influence to
get you a job in the legitimate circus!" And Mr. Spoopendyke
bolted from the house, thoroughly disgusted with private
theatricals.</p>

<h3>PAPA AND THE BOY<br />
BY J. L. HARBOUR</h3>

<p>Charming as is the merry prattle of innocent childhood, it is
not particularly agreeable at about one o'clock in the morning.
There are young and talkative children who have no more regard
for your feelings or for the proprieties of life than to open their
eyes with a snap at one or two in the morning, and to seek to
engage you in enlivening dialog of this sort.</p>

<p>"Papa."</p>

<p>You think you will pay no heed to the imperative little voice,
hoping that silence on your part will keep the youngster quiet;
but again that boy of three pipes out sharply:</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"Well?" you say.</p>

<p>"You 'wake, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So's me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear that you are," you say with cold sarcasm. "What
do you want?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nuffin."</p>

<p>"Well, lie still and go to sleep then."</p>

<p>"I isn't s'eepy, papa."</p>

<p>"Well, I am, young man."</p>

<p>"Is you? I isn't&mdash;not a bit. Say, papa, papa! If you was
wich what would you buy me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you buy me nuffin?"</p>

<p>"I guess so; now you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, papa?"</p>

<p>"Well, a steam engine, may be; now you go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span> right to sleep."</p>

<p>"With a bell that would ring, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; now you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And would the wheels go wound, papa?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes (<i>yawning</i>). Shut your eyes now, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And would it go choo, choo, choo, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; now go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Say, papa."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"Well, what now?"</p>

<p>"Is you 'fraid of the dark?"</p>

<p>"No" (<i>drowsily</i>).</p>

<p>"I isn't either. Papa!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If I was wich I'd buy you somefin."</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'd buy you some ice-cweam and some chocolum drops
and a toof brush and panties wiv bwaid on like mine, and a
candy wooster, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do. You must go to sleep now."</p>

<p>Silence for half a second, then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa! papa!"</p>

<p>"Well, what now?"</p>

<p>"I want a jink."</p>

<p>"No, you don't."</p>

<p>"I do, papa."</p>

<p>Experience has taught you that there will be no peace until
you have brought the "jink," and you scurry out to the bathroom
in the dark for it, knocking your shins against everything in the
room as you go.</p>

<p>"Now I don't want to hear another word from you to-night,"
you say, as he gulps down a mouthful of the water he didn't
want. Two minutes later he says:</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"See here, laddie, papa will have to punish you if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can spell 'dog,' papa."</p>

<p>"Well, nobody wants to hear you spell at two o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span></p>

<p>"B-o-g&mdash;dog; is that right?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. But nobody cares if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it's d-o-g, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; now you lie right down and go to sleep instantly."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be a good boy, won't I, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you'll be the best boy on earth. Good-night, dearie."</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"Well, well! What now?"</p>

<p>"Is I your little boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; of course."</p>

<p>"Some mans haven't got any little boys; but you have, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you had two, free, nine, 'leben, twenty-six,
ninety-ten, free hundred little boys?"</p>

<p>The mere possibility of such a remote and contingent calamity
so paralyzes you that you lie speechless for ten minutes during
which you hear a yawn or two in the little bed by your side,
a little figure rolls over three or four times, a pair of heels fly
into the air once or twice, a warm, moist little hand reaches out
and touches your face to make sure that you are there, and the
boy is asleep with his heels where his head ought to be.</p>



<h3>THE OBSTRUCTIVE HAT IN THE PIT<br />
BY F. ANSTEY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The Pit of a London theatre during Pantomime Time.</i></p>

<p><i>An Overheated Matron</i> (<i>to her husband</i>)&mdash;"Well, they don't
give you much room in 'ere, I must say. Still, we done better than
I expected, after all that crushing. I thought my ribs was gone
once&mdash;but it was on'y the umbrella's. You pretty comfortable
where you are, eh, father?"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Oh, I'm <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>right enough, I am."</p>

<p><i>Jimmy</i> (<i>their small boy with a piping voice</i>)&mdash;"If father is
it's more nor what I am. I can't see, mother, I can't!"</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"Lor' bles' the boy! there ain't nothen to see yet;
you'll see well enough when the curting goes up. (<i>Curtain rises
on opening scene.</i>) Look, Jimmy, ain't that nice, now? All them
himps, dancin' round and real fire comin' out of the pot&mdash;which
I 'ope it's quite safe&mdash;and there's a beautiful fairy just come
on drest so grand, too!"</p>

<p><i>Jimmy</i> (<i>whimpering</i>)&mdash;"I can't see no fairy&mdash;nor yet no himps&mdash;no
nothen!"</p>

<p><i>Mother</i> (<i>annoyed</i>)&mdash;"Was there ever such an aggravating boy?
Set quiet, do, and don't fidget, and look at the hactin'!"</p>

<p><i>Jimmy</i>&mdash;"I tell yer I can't see no hactin', mother. It ain't my
fault&mdash;it's this lady in front of me, with the 'at."</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"Father, the pore boy says he can't see where he is,
'cause of a lady's 'at in front."</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Well, I can't 'elp the 'at, can I? He must put up
with it, that's all!"</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"No&mdash;but I thought, if you wouldn't mind changing
places with him; you're taller than him."</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;It's always the way with you&mdash;never satisfied, you
ain't! Well, pass the boy across! I'm for a quiet life, I am
(<i>changing seats</i>). Will this do for you?" (<i>He settles down
immediately behind a very large, furry hat which he dodges for
some time.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Father</i> (<i>suddenly</i>)&mdash;"Blow the 'at."</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"You can't wonder at the boy not seeing! P'r'aps
the lady wouldn't mind taking it off, if you asked her?"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Ah! (<i>touching the owner of the hat on the shoulder</i>).
Excuse me, mum, but might I take the liberty of asking you to
kindly remove your 'at?" (<i>The owner of the hat deigns no reply.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Father</i> (<i>more insistently</i>)&mdash;"Would you 'ave any objection to
oblige me by taking off your 'at, mum? (<i>Same result.</i>) I don't
know if you 'eard me, mum, but I've asked you twice, civil
enough, to take that 'at of yours off. I'm playin' 'ide-and-seek
be'ind it 'ere!" (<i>No answer.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"People didn't ought to be allowed in the Pit with
sech 'ats! Callin' 'erself a lady, and settin' there in a great '<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>at
and feathers like a 'ighlander's, and never answering no more
nor a stuffed himage!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i> (<i>to the husband of the owner of the hat</i>)&mdash;"Will you
tell your good lady to take her 'at off, sir, please?"</p>

<p><i>The Owner of the Hat</i> (<i>to her husband</i>)&mdash;"Don't you do
nothing of the sort, Sam, or you'll 'ear of it!"</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"Some people are perlite, I must say. Parties might
be'ave as ladies when they come in the Pit! It's a pity her
'usband can't teach her better manners!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"'Im teach her! 'E knows better. 'E's got a Tartar
there, 'e 'as!"</p>

<p><i>The Owner of the Hat</i>&mdash;"Sam, are you going to set by and hear
me insulted like this?"</p>

<p><i>Her Husband</i> (<i>turning round tremulously</i>)&mdash;"I&mdash;I'll trouble
you to drop making these personal allusions to my wife's 'at, sir.
It's puffickly impossible to listen to what's going on on the stage,
with all these remarks be'ind!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Not more nor it is to see what's going on on the stage
with that 'at in front! I paid 'arf-a-crown to see the Pantermime,
I did; not to 'ave a view of your wife's 'at!.... 'ere,
Maria, blowed if I can stand this 'ere game any longer. Jimmy
must change places again, and if he can't see, he must stand up
on the seat, that's all!" (<i>Jimmy goes back and mounts upon the
seat.</i>)</p>

<p><i>A Pit-ite Behind Jimmy</i> (<i>touching Jimmy's father with an
umbrella</i>)&mdash;"Will you tell your little boy to set down, please,
and not to block the view like this?"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"If you can indooce that lady to take off her 'at,
I will, but not before. Stay where you are, Jimmy."</p>

<p><i>The Pit-ite Behind</i>&mdash;"Well, I must stand myself then, that's
all. I mean to see somehow!" (<i>He rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>People Behind</i> (<i>sternly</i>)&mdash;"Set down there, will yer?" (<i>He
resumes his seat expostulating.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jimmy</i>&mdash;"Father, the man behind is a-pinching of my legs!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Will you stop pinching my little boy's legs. He ain't
doing you no 'arm, is he?"</p>

<p><i>The Pinching Pit-ite</i>&mdash;"Let him sit down, then!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Let the lady take her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>'at off!"</p>

<p><i>Murmurs Behind</i>&mdash;"Order there! Set down! Put that boy
down! Take off that 'at! Silence in front there! Turn 'em
out! Shame!..."</p>

<p><i>The Husband of the Owner of the Hat</i> (<i>in a whisper to his
wife</i>)&mdash;"Take off the blessed 'at, and 'ave done with it, do!"</p>

<p><i>The Owner of the Hat</i>&mdash;"What, now? I'd sooner die in the
'at!" (<i>An attendant is called.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Attendant</i>&mdash;"Order, there, gentlemen, please, unless you want
to get turned out! No standing allowed on the seats; you're
disturbing the performance 'ere, you know!" (<i>Jimmy is made
to sit down, and weeps silently; the hubbub subsides, and the
Owner of the Hat triumphs.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"Never mind, my boy, you shall have mother's seat in
a minute. I dessay, if all was known, the lady 'as reasons for
keeping her 'at on, pore thing!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i>&mdash;"Ah, I never thought o' that. So she may. Very
likely her 'at won't come off&mdash;not without her 'air!"</p>

<p><i>Mother</i>&mdash;"Ah, well, then we mus'n't be 'ard on her."</p>

<p><i>The Owner of the Hat</i> (<i>removing the obstruction</i>)&mdash;"I 'ope
you're satisfied now, I'm sure?"</p>

<p><i>Father</i> (<i>handsomely</i>)&mdash;"Better late nor never, mum, and we
take it kind of you. Tho why you shouldn't ha' done it at fust,
I dunno; for you look a deal 'ansomer without the 'at than what
you did in it&mdash;don't she Maria?"</p>

<p><i>The Owner of the Hat</i> (<i>mollified</i>)&mdash;"Sam, ask the gentleman
behind if his boy would like a ginger-nut." (<i>This olive-branch
is accepted; compliments pass; cordiality is restored, and the
pantomime then proceeds without any further disturbance in the
audience.</i>)</p>

<p>"I guess I haf to gif up my delephone already," said an old
citizen, as he entered the office of the company with a very

<p>"Why, what's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"Oh! eferytings. I got dot delephone in mine house so I

<p>"Vhell, my poy Shon, in der saloon, he rings der pell and calls
me oop und says an old frent of mine vhants to see how she vorks.
Dot ish all right. I say, 'Hello!' und he says, 'Come closer.' I

<h3>DOCTOR MARIGOLD<br />
BY CHARLES DICKENS</h3>

<p>I am a Cheap Jack, and my own father's name was Willum
Marigold. It was in his lifetime supposed by some that his name
was William, but my own father always consistently said, No it
was Willum. On which point I content myself with looking at
the argument this way: If a man is not allowed to know his own
name in a free country, how much is he allowed to know in a
land of slavery?</p>

<p>I was born on the Queen's highway, but it was the King's at
that time. A doctor was fetched to my own mother by my own
father, when it took place on a common; and in consequence of
his being a very kind gentleman, and accepting no fee but a
tea-tray, I was named Doctor, out of gratitude and compliment
to him. There you have me. Doctor Marigold.</p>

<p>The doctor having accepted a tea-tray, you'll guess that my
father was a Cheap Jack before me. You are right. He was.
And my father was a lovely one in his time at the Cheap Jack
work. Now I'll tell you what. I mean to go down into my grave
declaring that, of all the callings ill-used in Great Britain, the
Cheap Jack calling is the worst used. Why ain't we a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>profession?
Why ain't we endowed with privileges? Why are we forced
to take out a hawker's license, when no such thing is expected
of the political hawkers? Where's the difference betwixt us?
Except that we are Cheap Jacks and they are Dear Jacks, I don't
see any difference but what's in our favor.</p>

<p>For look here! Say it's election-time. I am on the footboard
of my cart in the market-place on a Saturday night. I put up
a general miscellaneous lot. I say: "Now here, my free and independent
voters, I'm going to give you such a chance as you never
had in all your born days, nor yet the days preceding. Now I'll
show you what I am a-going to do with you. Here's a pair of
razors that'll shave you closer than the Board of Guardians; here's
a flat-iron worth its weight in gold; here's a frying-pan artificially
flavored with essence of beefsteaks to that degree that
you've only got for the rest of your lives to fry bread and dripping
in it, and there you are complete with animal food; here's
a genuine chronometer watch in such a solid silver case that you
may knock at the door with it when you come home late from a
social meeting, and rouse your wife and family and save up your
knocker for the post-man; and here's half a dozen dinner-plates
that you may play the cymbals with to charm the baby when it's
fractious. Stop. I'll throw you in another article, and I'll give
you that, and its a rolling-pin, and if the baby can only get it
well into its mouth when its teeth are coming, and rub the gums
once with it, they'll come through double, in a fit of laughter
equal to be tickled. Stop again! I'll throw you in another
article, because I don't like the looks of you, for you haven't the
appearance of buyers unless I lose by you, and because I'd rather
lose than not take money to-night, and that article's a looking-glass
in which you may see how ugly you look when you don't bid.
What do you say now? Come! Do you say a pound? Not you,
for you haven't got it. Do you say ten shillings? Not you, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>for
you owe more to the tallyman. Well, then, I'll tell you what
I'll do with you. I'll heap 'em all on the footboard of the cart&mdash;there
they are! razors, flat-iron, frying-pan, chronometer watch,
dinner-plates, rolling-pin, and looking-glass&mdash;take 'em all away
for four shillings, and I'll give you sixpence for your trouble!"
This is me, the Cheap Jack.</p>

<p>But on Monday morning, in the same market-place, comes the
Dear Jack on the hustings&mdash;<i>his</i> cart&mdash;and what does <i>he</i> say?
"Now, you free and independent voters, I am going to give you
such a chance" (he begins just like me) "as you never had in all
your born days, and that's the chance of sending myself to Parliament.
Now I'll tell you what I am a-going to do for you. Here's
the interests of this magnificent town promoted above all the rest
of the civilized and uncivilized earth. Here's your railways carried,
and your neighbors' railways jockeyed. Here's all your sons
in the Post Office. Here's Britannia smiling on you. Here's the
eyes of Europe on you. Here's uniwersal prosperity for you,
repletion of animal food, golden corn-fields, gladsome homesteads,
and rounds of applause from your own hearts, all in one lot,
and that's myself. Will you take me as I stand? You won't!
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'll do with you. Come now! I'll
throw you in anything you ask for. There! Church-rates, abolition
of church-rates, more malt tax, no malt tax, uniwersal education
to the highest mark, or uniwersal ignorance to the lowest,
total abolition of flogging in the army, or a dozen for every
private once a month all round, Wrongs of Men or Right of
Women&mdash;only say which it shall be, take 'em or leave 'em, and
I'm of your opinion altogether, and the lot's your own on your
own terms. There! You won't take it? Well, then, I'll tell you
what I'll do with you. Come! You <i>are</i> such free and independent
woters, and I <i>am</i> so proud of you&mdash;you <i>are</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>such a noble
and enlightened constituency, and I <i>am</i> so ambitious of the honor
and dignity of being your member, which is by far the highest
level to which the wings of the human mind can soar&mdash;that I'll
tell you what I'll do with you. I'll throw you in all public-houses
in your magnificent town for nothing. Will that content you?
It won't? You won't take the lot yet? Well, then, before I put
the horse in and drive away, and make the offer to the next most
magnificent town that can be discovered, I'll tell you what I'll
do. Take the lot, and I'll drop two thousand pound in the streets
of your magnificent town for them to pick up that can. Not
enough? Now look here. This is the very farthest that I'm
a-going to. I'll make it two thousand five hundred. And still you
won't? Here, missis! Put the horse&mdash;No, stop half a moment,
I shouldn't like to turn my back upon you, neither, for a trifle,
I'll make it two thousand seven hundred and fifty pound. There!
Take the lot on your own terms, and I'll count out two thousand
seven hundred and fifty pound on the footboard of the cart, to
be dropt in the streets of your magnificent town for them to
pick up that can. What do you say? Come now! You won't
do better, and you may do worse. You take it? Hooray! Sold
again, and got the seat!"</p>


<h3>THE RULING PASSION<br />
BY WILLIAM H. SIVITER</h3>

<p>She had never mailed a letter before, and so she approached the
stamp clerk's window with the same air that she would enter a
dry-goods store.</p>

<p>"I would like to look at some stamps, please."</p>

<p>"What denomination do you want?"</p>

<p>"Denomination?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Is it for a letter or a newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to send a letter to my Uncle John; he's just moved
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you need a two-cent stamp," said the clerk offering her
one of that value.</p>

<p>"I hardly like that color!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span></p>
<p>"That is a two-cent stamp, madam. Please stand aside, and let
the gentleman behind you come up."</p>

<p>"But haven't you got them in any other color? I never did
like that shade of red."</p>

<p>"There is only one color."</p>

<p>"That is strange. I'd think you'd keep them in different
shades, so that there'd be some choice. You are sure you have
none in a brighter red, or even in a different color&mdash;Nile green,
or seal brown, or jubilee blue, for instance?"</p>

<p>"You can put two one-cent stamps on your letter if you like."</p>

<p>"Let me see them, please. Ah, that will do. I like that shade
so much better. I'll take only one, if you please."</p>

<p>"If it's for a letter you'll need two. These are one-cent stamps
and letter postage is two cents per ounce."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to put two stamps on my letter; I don't
think they will look well."</p>

<p>"It requires two cents to carry a letter, madam, and you must
either put a two-cent stamp on or two ones. It won't go without.
I must ask you to please hurry, for you are keeping a great many
people away from the window."</p>

<p>"That's singular. I don't like the looks of two together. You
are sure the other doesn't come in seal-brown, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, madam; no!"</p>

<p>"Then I'll have to see if I can suit myself elsewhere."</p>

<p>And she departed.</p>

<h3>HIS LEG SHOT OFF<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>You have all met him. He is the man with the funny story.
As a listener he would be popular. If he would only keep quiet
and listen to other people tell stories without attempting to emulate
their ability he would be liked where he is now cordially disliked.
But that doesn't suit his temperament. He will buttonhole
you with his forefinger, and with an idiotic smile on his face say.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha! If I didn't just hear the funniest thing!
Oh, but it was funny! Ha! ha! ha! You don't begin to know
how funny it was! You see it was this way: A long time ago
there was a war,&mdash;fighting,&mdash;fighting, you know,&mdash;between the
North and South. Ha! ha! ha! There was a war, as I was saying,
and they got fighting, and this man,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;the funniest
thing!&mdash;this man, Jim Jones,&mdash;you see it was this way,&mdash;it
was in the war, you know,&mdash;between the North and South,&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;and this man Jim Jones,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;it is too funny for
any thing,&mdash;it was too funny! Well, Jim Jones was fighting.
He went into the battle one day, and that is the funny part of
it. Along came a cannon-ball and took off his head! Ha! ha! ha!
(<i>Laugh here for two minutes; then the face gradually assumes
an air of gravity.</i>) No, it wasn't his head, it was his leg. It was
funny just the same. Down he went to the ground. It stands
to reason a man with one leg can't walk and go on fighting. So
he just laid down in his tracks. Couldn't do anything else. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
then along came a battery,&mdash;you know that is cannons,&mdash;they
have horses to drag them,&mdash;men can't pull those big, heavy cannons
into battle. Well, you know, this man Jim Jones that had his
leg shot off, he knew this man with the cannons,&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;Oh,
but it was funny! And he says to him, 'If you don't carry me
to where a doctor is, my wife's a widow, that's all about it!' He
knew his wife was a widow if he didn't get to where the doctor
was. You know the doctors don't stay up where the soldiers are
fighting in a battle,&mdash;they're back, away back, the doctors are.
So this man with his leg shot off, he says, 'You've got to take me
where a doctor is, or my wife's a widow, that's all about it!' Well,
this neighbor of his didn't like to go back on an old friend,&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;with his leg shot off,&mdash;this man that had his leg shot
off early in the battle and couldn't go on fighting,&mdash;but he says
to him: 'How am I to get you back there?' and he 'lowed he'd
have to carry him. Well, with that he shouldered Jim Jones,&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;threw him over his shoulder just like that, and away
they went! (<i>Laugh heartily here.</i>) And that is where the joke
came in,&mdash;along came a cannon-ball and took of his head! Not
the man's head, but Jimmy Jones' head! But pshaw, the man
didn't know anything about it. Along he went with Jimmy over
his shoulder. Just then an officer came up. He says: 'Where
are you going with that thing?' Well, the man didn't like to give
a short answer. Soldiers are not allowed to give short answers
to officers. He simply saluted and says: 'Well, it's this way:
This man's an old neighbor of mine. He was coming into battle,&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;and he 'lowed that a cannon-ball came along and
took off his leg. He says if we don't take him to where a doctor
is his wife's a widow and that's all about it,&mdash;and so,&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;and
so I'm just taking him back to where the doctor is, captain.'
The captain looked at him a moment, and he says: 'Why you
idiot, it isn't his leg, it's his head!' Then the man says,&mdash;not
Jimmy Jones,&mdash;he had his head off and couldn't say anything,&mdash;'Oh,
the confounded rascal, he told me it was his leg!'"</p>

<h3>THE MAN WHO WILL MAKE A SPEECH<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>A man wearing passably good clothes and a look of mental
anxiety entered a fashionable drug-store, and said to the clerk:</p>

<p>"Are you pretty well posted on big words?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the clerk, "I know quite a large number of big
words."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the stranger, "here's the situation: Out
where I live I am a pretty big gun, and when anything is going
on they call on me for a speech. I made one on election day,
another the same evening, and another the next morning, and
now I'm laying the sleepers for a speech to eclipse them all."</p>

<p>"What sort of a speech?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"Political, of course. My other speeches were political, but
were very plain. This time I want to get in some regular old
twisters. For one thing I would declare this country in a state
of&mdash;what do you call it?"</p>

<p>"Peace!"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I mean confusion, excitement, and so on. There's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
a word to signify it, but I can't speak it."</p>

<p>"Abject terrorism?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. Its archany, or something of the kind."</p>

<p>"I guess you mean anarchy, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I do! Bless me if I haven't been trying for a whole
hour to get that word! That's the very thing. When called out
I want to lead off with: 'Fellow citizens, the peace has flown,
and arnica reigns supreme!' I guess that will knock them."</p>

<p>"You don't mean arnica&mdash;you mean anarchy."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean, of course, but every time I think anarchy
I get it arnica, and I don't know but I will have to give up the
speech."</p>

<p>"Why don't you write it down?"</p>

<p>The man took up a pen and wrote: "A-r-k-a-n-y." Then he
said: "Peace has fled and arkany reigns in the land."</p>

<p>"I told you it was anarchy."</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;that's so. This suspense is telling on my memory
like a fit of illness. Now, then, a-n-a-r-k-y, anarky, and don't
you forget it. You needn't say anything about my calling in
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. Over seven-eighths of the best speakers
in town come to me for big words."</p>

<p>"Many thanks; and now, 'Fellow citizens, peace has fled far,
far away, and arkany reigns&mdash;&mdash;' Hold on, is that the right
word?"</p>

<p>He halted at the door to examine the slip of paper, and after
repeating the right word over several times he went on:</p>

<p>"A state of anchovy is upon us, and where will it end?"</p>

<p>As he walked up the street he was overheard to say:</p>

<p>"Arnica! Arnica! where will it end?"</p>

<h3>A SHORT SERMON<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>(<i>Delivered in usual singsong style of the conventional curate.</i>)
I am going to preach to you this morning, my friends, upon
the young man who was sick of the palsy. Now, this young man
was sick of the palsy. The palsy, as you are all aware, is a very
terrible disease, a wasting scourge. And this young man was
sick of the palsy. And the palsy, as you know, is strongly
hereditary. It had been in his family. His father had been sick
of the palsy, and his mother had been sick of the palsy, and they
had <i>all</i> of them, in fact, been sick of the palsy. And this young
man had been sick of the palsy. Yes, my dear friends, he had had
it for years and years, and&mdash;<i>he was sick of it</i>.</p>

<h3>HIS BLACKSTONIAN CIRCUMLOCUTION<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>"I received, this afternoon," said the bright-eyed, common-sense
girl, the while a slight blush of maidenly coyness tinted her peach-hued
cheeks, "a written proposal of marriage from Horace J.
Pokelong, the rising young attorney, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huh! that petrified dub!" jealously ejaculated the young dry-goods
dealer, who had been hanging back because of his timidity
and excessive adoration.</p>

<p>"He says," proceeded the maiden, gently ignoring the interruption,
and reading aloud from the interesting document, "'I have
carefully and comprehensively analyzed my feelings toward you,
and the result is substantially as follows, to wit: I respect, admire,
adore and love you, and hereby give, grant and convey to
you my heart and all my interest, right and title in and to the

and extending his arms. "Miss Brisk&mdash;Maud&mdash;I love you! Will
you marry me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will!" promptly answered the lass, as she contentedly
snuggled up in his encircling embrace. "And I'll reply to the

not have retentive memories, so as to be able to repeat it to others.
Failures of this kind are sometimes very ludicrous. We give
some good specimens.</p>

<p>The most famous of this class was the college professor, who,
on parting with a student that had called on him, noticed that
he had a new coat, and remarked that it was too short.</p>

<p>The student, with an air of resignation, replied: "It will be
long enough before I get another."</p>

<p>The professor enjoyed the joke heartily, and going to a meeting
of the college faculty just afterward, he entered the room in
great glee and said:</p>

<p>"Young Sharp got off such a joke just now. He called on me
a little while ago, and as he was leaving, I noticed his new coat,
and told him it was too short, and he said: "It will be a long time
before I get another."</p>

<p>No one laughed, and the professor sobering down, remarked:
"It doesn't seem so funny as when he said it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span></p>

<p>A red-haired woman who was ambitious of literary distinction
found but poor sale for her book. A gentleman, in speaking of
her disappointment, said: "Her hair is red (read) if her book is
not." An auditor, in attempting to relate the joke elsewhere, said:
"She has red hair if her book hasn't."</p>

<p>The most unfortunate attempt at reproducing another's wit
was made by an Englishman who didn't understand the pun, but
judged from the applause with which it was greeted that it must
be excellent. During a dinner at which he was a guest a waiter
let a boiled tongue slip off the plate on which he was bearing it,
and it fell on the table.</p>

<p>The host at once apologized for the mishap as a <i>lapsus linguæ</i>
(slip of the tongue). The joke was the best thing at the
dinner, and our friend concluded to bring it up at his own table.</p>

<p>He accordingly invited his company and instructed his servant
to let fall a roast of beef as he was bringing it to the table.</p>

<p>When the "accident" occurred, he exclaimed: "That's a <i>lapsus
linguæ</i>."</p>

<p>Nobody laughed, and he said again, "I say that's a <i>lapsus linguæ</i>,"
and still no one laughed.</p>

<p>A screw was loose somewhere; so he told about the tongue falling,
and they did laugh.</p>

<p>"Why is this," said a waiter, holding up a common kitchen
utensil, "more remarkable than Napoleon Bonaparte? Because
Napoleon was a great man, but this is a grater." When the funny
man reproduced it in his circle, he asked the question right, but
answered it, "Because Napoleon was a great man, but this is a
nutmeg-grater."</p>


<h3>THE CYCLOPEEDY<br />
BY EUGENE FIELD</h3>

<p>Havin' lived next door to the Hobart place f'r goin' on thirty
years, I calc'late that I know jest about ez much about the case
ez anybody else now on airth, exceptin' perhaps it's ol' Jedge
Baker, and he's so plaguey old 'nd so powerful feeble that <i>he</i>
don't know nothin'.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span></p>

<p>It seems that in the spring uv '47&mdash;the year that Cy Watson's
oldest boy wuz drownded in West River&mdash;there come along a book
agent sellin' volyumes 'nd tracks f'r the diffusion uv knowledge,
'nd havin' got the recommend of the minister 'nd uv the select-men,
he done an all-fired big business in our part uv the county.
His name wuz Lemuel Higgins, 'nd he wuz ez likely a talker ez
I ever heerd, barrin' Lawyer Conkey, 'nd everybody allowed that
when Conkey wuz round he talked so fast that the town pump
ud have to be greased every twenty minutes.</p>

<p>One of the first uv our folks that this Lemuel Higgins struck
wuz Leander Hobart. Leander had jest marr'd one uv the Peasley
girls, 'nd had moved into the old homestead on the Plainville road,&mdash;old
Deacon Hobart havin' give up the place to him, the other
boys havin' moved out West (like a lot o' darned fools that they
wuz!). Leander wuz feelin' his oats jest about this time, 'nd
nuthin' wuz too good f'r him.</p>

<p>"Hattie," sez he, "I guess I'll have to lay in a few books f'r
readin' in the winter time, 'nd I've half a notion to subscribe f'r
a cyclopeedy. Mr. Higgins here says they're invalerable in a
family, and that we orter have 'em, bein' as how we're likely to
have the fam'ly bime by."</p>

<p>"Lor's sakes, Leander, how you talk!" sez Hattie, blushin' all
over, ez brides allers does to heern tell uv sich things.</p>

<p>Waal, to make a long story short, Leander bargained with Mr.
Higgins for a set uv them cyclopeedies, 'nd he signed his name
to a long printed paper that showed how he agreed to take a
cyclopeedy oncet in so often, which wuz to be ez often ez a new
one uv the volyumes wuz printed. A cyclopeedy isn't printed all
at oncet, because that would make it cost too much; consekently
the man that gets it up has it strung along fur apart, so as to
hit folks once every year or two, and gin'rally about harvest
time. So Leander kind uv liked the idee, and he signed the
printed paper 'nd made his affidavit to it afore Jedge Warner.</p>

<p>The fust volyume of the cyclopeedy stood on a shelf in the old
seckertary in the settin'-room about four months before they had
any use f'r it. One night 'Squire Tuner's son come over to visit
Leander 'nd Hattie, and they got to talkin' about apples, 'nd
the sort uv apples that wuz the best. Leander allowed that the
Rhode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span> Island greenin' wuz the best, but Hattie and the Turner
boy stuck up f'r the Roxbury russet, until at last a happy idee
struck Leander, and sez he: "We'll leave it to the cyclopeedy,
b'gosh! Whichever one the cyclopeedy sez is the best will settle
it."</p>

<p>"But you can't find out nothin' 'bout Roxbury russets nor
Rhode Island greenin's in <i>our</i> cyclopeedy," sez Hattie.</p>

<p>"Why not, I'd like to know?" sez Leander, kind uv indignant
like.</p>

<p>"'Cause ours hain't got down to the R yet," sez Hattie. "All
ours tells about is things beginnin' with A."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't we talkin' about Apples!" sez Leander. "You
aggervate me terrible, Hattie, by insistin' on knowin' what you
don't know nothin' 'bout."</p>

<p>Leander went to the seckertary 'nd took down the cyclopeedy
'nd hunted all through it f'r Apples, but all he could find wuz
"Apple&mdash;See Pomology."</p>

<p>"How in the thunder kin I see Pomology," sez Leander, "when
there ain't no Pomology to see? Gol durn a cyclopeedy, anyhow!"</p>

<p>And he put the volyume back onto the shelf 'nd never sot eyes
into it agin.</p>

<p>That's the way the thing run f'r years 'nd years. Leander
would've gin up the plaguey bargain, but he couldn't; he had
signed a printed paper 'nd had swore to it before a justice of the
peace. Higgins would have had the law on him if he had throwed
up the trade.</p>

<p>The most aggervatin' feature uv it all wuz that a new one uv
them cussid cyclopeedies wuz allus sure to show up at the wrong
time,&mdash;when Leander wuz hard up or had jest been afflicted some
way or other. His barn burnt down two nights afore the volyume
containin' the letter B arrived, and Leander needed all his chink
to pay f'r lumber, but Higgins sot back on that affidavit and defied
the life out uv him.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Leander," sez his wife, soothin' like, "it's a good
book to have in the house, anyhow, now that we've got a baby."</p>

<p>"That's so," sez Leander, "babies does begin with B, don't it?"</p>

<p>You see their fust baby had been born; they named him Peasley,&mdash;Peasley
Hobart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>&mdash;after Hattie's folks. So, seein' as how
he wuz payin' f'r a book that told about babies, Leander didn't
begredge that five dollars so very much after all.</p>

<p>"Leander," sez Hattie, "that B cyclopeedy ain't no account.
There ain't nothin' in it about babies except 'See Maternity'!"</p>

<p>"Waal, I'll be gosh durned!" sez Leander. That wuz all he
said, and he couldn't do nothin' at all, f'r that book agent, Lemuel
Higgins, had the dead-wood on him,&mdash;the mean, sneakin'
critter!</p>

<p>So the years passed on, one of the cyclopeedies showin' up
now 'nd then,&mdash;sometimes every two years 'nd sometimes every
four, but allus at a time when Leander found it pesky hard to
give up a fiver. It warn't no use cussin' Higgins; Higgins jest
laffed when Leander allowed that the cyclopeedy wuz no good 'nd
that he wuz bein' robbed. Meantime Leander's family wuz increasin'
and growin'. Little Sarey had the hoopin'-cough dreadful
one winter, but the cyclopeedy didn't help out at all, 'cause
all it said wuz: "Hoopin' Cough&mdash;See Whoopin' Cough"&mdash;and
uv course, there warn't no Whoopin' Cough to see, bein' as how
the W hadn't come yet.</p>

<p>Oncet when Hiram wanted to dreen the home pasture, he went
to the cyclopeedy to find out about it, but all he diskivered wuz:
"Drain&mdash;See Tile." This wuz in 1859, and the cyclopeedy had
only got down to G.</p>

<p>The cow wuz sick with lung fever one spell, and Leander laid
her dyin' to that cussid cyclopeedy, 'cause when he went to readin'
'bout cows it told him to "See Zoology."</p>

<p>But what's the use uv harrowin' up one's feelin's talkin' 'nd
thinkin' about these things? Leander got so after a while that
the cyclopeedy didn't worry him at all: he grew to look at it ez
one uv the crosses that human critters has to bear without complainin'
through this vale uv tears. The only thing that bothered
him wuz the fear that mebbe he wouldn't live to see the last
volyume,&mdash;to tell the truth, this kind uv got to be his hobby, and
I've heern him talk 'bout it many a time settin' round the stove
at the tavern 'nd squirtin' tobacco juice at the sawdust box. His
wife, Hattie, passed away with the yaller janders the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>winter W
come, and all that seemed to reconcile Leander to survivin' her
wuz the prospect uv seein' the last volyume uv that cyclopeedy.
Lemuel Higgins, the book agent, had gone to his everlastin' punishment;
but his son, Hiram, had succeeded to his father's business
'nd continued to visit the folks his old man had roped in.
By this time Leander's children had growed up; all on 'em wuz
marr'd, and there wuz numeris grandchildren to amuse the ol'
gentleman. But Leander wuzn't to be satisfied with the common
things uv airth; he didn't seem to take no pleasure in his grandchildren
like most men do; his mind wuz allers sot on somethin'
else,&mdash;for hours 'nd hours, yes, all day long, he'd set out on the
front stoop lookin' wistfully up the road for that book agent to
come along with a cyclopeedy. He didn't want to die till he'd
got all the cyclopeedies his contract called for; he wanted to have
everything straightened out before he passed away.</p>

<p>When&mdash;oh, how well I recollect it&mdash;when Y come along he wuz
so overcome that he fell over in a fit uv paralysis, 'nd the old
gentleman never got over it. For the next three years he drooped
'nd pined and seemed like he couldn't hold out much longer. Finally
he had to take to his bed,&mdash;he was so old 'nd feeble,&mdash;but he
made 'em move the bed up ag'inst the window so he could watch
for that last volyume of the cyclopeedy.</p>

<p>The end come one balmy day in the spring uv '87. His life wuz
a-ebbin' powerful fast; the minister wuz there, 'nd me, 'nd Dock
Wilson, 'nd Jedge Baker, 'nd most uv the fam'ly. Lovin' hands
smoothed the wrinkled forehead 'nd breshed back the long, scant,
white hair, but the eyes of the dyin' man wuz sot upon that piece
uv road over which the cyclopeedy man allus come.</p>

<p>All to oncet a bright 'nd joyful look come into them eyes, 'nd
ol' Leander riz up in bed 'nd sez: "It's come!"</p>

<p>"What is it, father?" asked his daughter Sarey, sobbin' like.</p>

<p>"Hush," sez the minister, solemnly; "he sees the shinin' gates
uv the Noo Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the aged man; "it is the cyclopeedy&mdash;the letter
Z&mdash;it's comin'!"</p>

<p>And, sure enough! the door opened, and in walked Higgins.
He tottered rather than walked, f'r he had growed old 'nd feeble
in his wicked perfession.</p>

<p>"Here's the Z cyclopeedy, Mr. Hobart," says Higgins.</p>

<p>Leander clutched it; he hugged it to his pantin' bosom; then
stealin' one pale hand under the pillar he drew out a faded banknote
'nd gave it to Higgins.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span></p>
<p>"I thank Thee for this boon," sez Leander, rollin' his eyes up
devoutly; then he gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Hold on," cried Higgins, excitedly, "you've made a mistake&mdash;it
isn't the last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Leander didn't hear him&mdash;his soul hed fled from its mortal
tenement 'nd hed soared rejoicin' to realms uv everlastin' bliss.</p>

<p>"He is no more," sez Dock Wilson, metaphorically.</p>

<p>"Then who are his heirs?" asked that mean critter Higgins.</p>

<p>"We be," sez the fam'ly.</p>

<p>"Do you conjointly and severally acknowledge and assume the
obligation of deceased to me?" he asked 'em.</p>

<p>"What obligation?" asked Peasley Hobart, stern like.</p>

<p>"Deceased died owin' me f'r a cyclopeedy!" sez Higgins.</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" sez Peasley. "We seen him pay you for the Z!"</p>

<p>"But there's another one to come," sez Higgins.</p>

<p>"Another?" they all asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, the index," sez he. So there wuz.</p>

<h3>HENRY THE FIFTH'S WOOING<br />
BY SHAKESPEARE</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3"><i>K. Henry.</i> Fair Katharine, and most fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Such as will enter at a lady's ear<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Katharine.</i> Your majesty shall mock at me; I can not speak
your England.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with
your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly
with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Pardonnez-moi, I can not tell vat is "like me."</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Que dit-il? que je suis semblable à les anges?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to
affirm it.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> O les langues des hommes sont pleines des tromperies.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men are
full of deceits?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits: dat
is de princess.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,
Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding; I am glad thou
canst speak no better English; for, if thou couldst, thou wouldst
find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my
farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
directly to say, "I love you": then if you urge me further than
to say, "Do you in faith?" I wear out my suit. Give me your
answer; i' faith, do: and so clap hands and a bargain: how say
you, lady?</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one I have neither
words nor measures, and for the other, I have no strength in measure,
yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady
at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my
back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should
quickly leap into a wife. Or if I buffet for my love, or bound my
horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a
jackanapes, never off. But, Kate, I can not look greenly nor
gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation:
only downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor never
break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper,
Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning, that never looks in
his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: if thou canst love me for
this, take me: if not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but
for thy love, no; yet I love thee, too. And while thou livest, dear
Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce
must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in
other places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme
themselves into ladies' favors, they do always reason themselves
out again. What! a speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a
ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black
beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow bald; a fair face
will wither; a full eye will wax hollow: but a good heart, Kate,
is the sun and the moon; or rather the sun and not the moon,
for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a
soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what sayest thou then
to my love? speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of
France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love the friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
France; for I love France so well that I will not part with a village
of it; I will have it all mine; and, Kate, when France is
mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> I can not tell vat is dat.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her
husband's neck, hardly to be shook off. Quand j'ay la possession
de France, et quand vous avez la possession de moi,&mdash;let me see,
what then? Saint Denis be my speed!&mdash;donc votre est France
et vous êtes mienne. It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the
kingdom as to speak so much more French; I shall never move
thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Sauf votre honneur, le François que vous parlez, est
meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> No, faith, is't not, Kate; but thy speaking of my
tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs be granted to
be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English,
canst thou love me?</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> I can not tell.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Can any of your neighbors tell Kate. I'll ask them.
Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into
your closet, you'll question this gentlewoman about me; and I
know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you
love With your heart; but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly. How answer
you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon très chère et divine
déesse?</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Your majestee ave faussee French enough to deceive
de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honor, in
true English, I love thee, Kate; by which honor I dare not swear
thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost,
notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage.
I was created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron,
that, when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith
Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear; my comfort is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
that old age, that ill layer up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon
my face: thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better: and therefore,
tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me? Put off your
maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks
of an empress; take me by the hand, and say, "Harry of England,
I am thine"; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear
withal, but I will tell thee aloud, "England is thine, Ireland is
thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine"; who,
tho I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best
king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your
answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English
broken; therefore, queen of all, Katharine, break thy mind to me
in broken English; wilt thou have me?</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Dat is as it sall please de Roi mon père.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him,
Kate.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Den it sall also content me.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.</p>

<p><i>Kath.</i> Il n'est pas la coutume de France.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Madam my interpreter, what says she?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France&mdash;I
can not tell vat is <i>baiser</i> en Anglish.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> To kiss.</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> It is not the fashion for the maids in France to kiss
before they are married, would you say?</p>

<p><i>Alice.</i> Oui, vraiment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span></p>
<p><i>K. Hen.</i> O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear
Kate, you and I can not be confined within the weak list of a
country's fashion: we are the makers of manners, Kate; and the
liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults;
as I will do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your country
in denying me a kiss; therefore, patiently and yielding. (<i>Kisses
her.</i>) You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence
in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French
council; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than
a general petition of monarchs.</p>


<h3>SCENE FROM "THE RIVALS"<br />
BY RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN</h3>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> There, Sir Anthony, there stands the deliberate simpleton
who wants to disgrace her family and lavish herself on a
fellow not worth a shilling.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Madam, I thought you once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> You thought, miss! I don't know any business you
have to think at all. Thought does not become a young woman.
But the point we would request of you is, that you will promise
to forget this fellow&mdash;to illiterate him, I say, from your memory.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Ah, madam! our memories are independent of our wills.
It is not so easy to forget.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> But I say it is, miss! There is nothing on earth so
easy as to forget, if a person chooses to set about it. I'm sure I
have as much forgot your poor, dear uncle as if he had never existed,
and I thought it my duty to do so; and let me tell you,
Lydia, these violent memories don't become a young woman.</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> Surely, the young woman does not pretend to remember
what she is ordered to forget! Ah, this comes of her reading.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> What crime, madam, have I committed, to be treated
thus?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Now don't attempt to extirpate yourself from the matter;
you know I have proof controvertible of it. But tell me, will
you promise me to do as you are bid? Will you take a husband
of your friends' choosing?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Madam, I must tell you plainly that, had I no preference
for any one else, the choice you have made would be my
aversion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> What business have you, miss, with preference and
aversion? They don't become a young woman; and you ought
to know that, as both always wear off, 'tis safest, in matrimony,
to begin with a little aversion. I am sure I hated your poor dear
uncle before marriage as if he'd been a blackamoor, and yet,
miss, you are sensible what a wife I made; and, when it pleased
heaven to release me from him, 'tis unknown what tears I shed!</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> He-e-m!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> But, suppose we were going to give you another
choice, will you promise us to give up this Beverley?</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Could I belie my thoughts so far as to give that promise,
my actions would certainly as far belie my words.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Take yourself to your room! You are fit company
for nothing but your own ill humors.</p>

<p><i>Lyd.</i> Willingly, ma'am; I can not change for the worse. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> There's a little intricate hussy for you!</p>

<p><i>Sir. A.</i> It is not to be wondered at, ma'am; all that is the natural
consequence of teaching girls to read. In my way hither,
Mrs. Malaprop, I observed your niece's maid coming forth from
a circulating library; she had a book in each hand&mdash;they were
half-bound volumes, with marble covers. From that moment, I
guessed how full of duty I should see her mistress!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Those are vile places, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> Madam, a circulating library in a town is as an evergreen
tree of diabolical knowledge! It blossoms through the year!
And, depend upon it, Mrs. Malaprop, that they who are so fond
of handling the leaves, will long for the fruit at last.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Fie, fie, Sir Anthony; you surely speak laconically.
(<i>Sir Anthony places a chair for her and another for himself,
bows to her respectfully and waits till she is seated.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> Why, Mrs. Malaprop, in moderation, now, what would
you have a woman know?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Observe me, Sir Anthony&mdash;I would by no means wish
a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning. I don't think
so much learning becomes a young woman. For instance&mdash;I
would never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or algebra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span> or
simony, or Fluxions, or paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches
of learning; nor will it be necessary for her to handle any of
your mathematical, astronomical, diabolical instruments; but, Sir
Anthony, I would send her, at nine years old, to a boarding-school,
in order to learn a little ingenuity and artifice. Then, sir,
she should have a supercilious knowledge in accounts; and, as
she grew up, I would have her instructed in geometry, that she
might know something of the contagious countries; above all, she
should be a perfect mistress of orthodoxy&mdash;that is, she should
not mispronounce and misspell words as our young women of the
present day constantly do. This, Sir Anthony, is what I would
have a woman know; and I don't think there is a superstitious
article in it.</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> Well, well, Mrs. Malaprop, I will dispute the point no
further with you, tho I must confess that you are a truly moderate
and polite arguer, for almost every third word you say is on
my side of the question. But to the more important point in debate&mdash;you
say you have no objection to my proposal?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> None, I assure you. I am under no positive engagement
with Mr. Acres; and as Lydia is so obstinate against him,
perhaps your son may have better success.</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> Well, madam, I will write for the boy directly. He
knows not a syllable of this yet, tho I have for some time had the
proposal in my head. He is at present with his regiment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> We have never seen your son, Sir Anthony; but I
hope no objection on his side.</p>

<p><i>Sir A.</i> Objection! Let him object, if he dare! No, no, Mrs.
Malaprop; Jack knows that the least demur puts me in a frenzy
directly. My process was always very simple. In his younger
days 'twas&mdash;"Jack, do this." If he demurred, I knocked him
down; and if he grumbled at that, I always sent him out of the
room.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Ay, and the properest way, o' my conscience! Nothing
is so conciliating to young people as severity. (<i>Both rise.</i>)
Well, Sir Anthony, I shall give Mr. Acres his discharge, and prepare
Lydia to receive your son's invocations; and I hope you
will represent her to the captain as an object not altogether
illegible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Sir A.</i> Madam, I will handle the subject prudently. I must
leave you. Good morning, Mrs. Malaprop. (<i>Both bow profoundly;
Sir Anthony steps back as if to go out, then returns to say</i>:)
And let me beg you, Mrs. Malaprop, to enforce this matter
roundly to the girl&mdash;take my advice, keep a tight hand. Good-morning,
Mrs. Malaprop. If she rejects this proposal, clap her
under lock and key. Good-morning, Mrs. Malaprop. And if you
were just to let the servants forget to bring her dinner for three
or four days, you can't conceive how she'd come about. Good-morning,
Mrs. Malaprop.</p>


<h3>SCENES FROM "RIP VAN WINKLE"<br />
AS RECITED BY THE LATE A. P. BURBANK</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters</span>: <i>Rip Van Winkle; Derrick Von Beekman, the villain
of the play, who endeavors to get Rip drunk in order to have
him sign away his property to Von Beekman; Nick Vedder, the
village innkeeper.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>: <i>The village inn. Von Beekman, alone. Enter Rip,
laughing like a child himself, and shaking off the children.</i></p>

<p><i>Rip</i> (<i>to the children outside</i>). Hey! You let my dog Schneider
alone dere; you hear dat, Sock der Jacob, der bist eine fordonner
spitspoo&mdash;yah&mdash;&mdash;Why, hullo, Derrick! how you was?
Did you hear dem liddle fellers just now? Dey most plague me
crazy. Ha, ha, ha! I like to laugh my outsides in every time I
tink about it. Just now, as we was comin' through the willage&mdash;Schneider
und me&mdash;Schneider's my dog; I don't know whether
you know him? Well, dem liddle fellers, dey took Schneider und&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!&mdash;dey&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;<i>dey tied a tin-kettle mit Schneider's
tail!</i> Ha, ha, ha! My, how he did run den, mit the kettle banging
about! My, how scared he was! Well, I didn't hi him comin'.
He run betwixt me und my legs und spilt me und all dem children
in the mud,&mdash;yah, dat's a fact. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Derrick.</i> Ah, yes, that's all right, Rip, very funny, very funny;
but what do you say to a glass of liquor, Rip?</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> What do I generally say to a glass? I generally say it's
a fine thing&mdash;when dere's plenty in it&mdash;und I say more to what
is <i>in</i> it than to the glass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Derrick.</i> Certainly, certainly. Say, hello there! Nick Vedder,
bring out a bottle of your best.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Dat's right&mdash;fill 'em up. You wouldn't believe it, Derrick,
dat's the first one I've had to-day. I guess, maybe, the
reason is, I couldn't got it before. Ah, Derrick, my score is too
big! Well, here is your good health und your family's, und may
dey all live long und prosper! Ah, you may well go "Ah" und
smack your chops over dat. You don't give me such schnapps
when I come. Where you got dat?</p>

<p><i>Nick.</i> That's high Dutch, Rip,&mdash;high Dutch, and ten years in
bottle.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Well, come on, fill 'em up again. Git out mit dat vater,
Nick Vedder; I don't want no vater in my liquor. Good liquor
und vater, Derrick, is just like man und wife&mdash;<i>dey don't agree
well togedder!</i> Dat's me und <i>my</i> wife, anyway. Well, come on
again. Here is your good health und your family's, und may dey
all live long und prosper!</p>

<p><i>Nick.</i> That's right, Rip; drink away, and "drown your sorrows
in the flowing bowl."</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Drown my sorrows? Yah, but <i>she</i> won't drown. My
wife is my sorrow und you cannick drown her. She tried it once,
but she couldn't do it. Didn't you know dat Gretchen like to get
drown? No? Dat's the funniest thing of the whole of it. It's
the same day I got married; she was comin' across dat Hudson
River dere in the ferry-boat to get married mit me.</p>

<p><i>Derrick.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Well, the boat she was comin' in got upsetted.</p>

<p><i>Derrick.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Well, but she wasn't in it.</p>

<p><i>Nick.</i> Oh!</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> No, dat's what I say; if she had been in the boat what
got upsetted, maybe she might have got drowned. She got left
behind somehow or odder. Women is always behind dat way&mdash;always.</p>

<p><i>Derrick.</i> But surely, Rip, you would have risked your life to
save her.</p>

<p><i>Rip</i> (<i>incredulously</i>). You mean I would yump in und pull
Gretchen out? Oh, would I? Oh, you mean den&mdash;yes, I believe
I would den. But it would be a good deal more my duty now
as it was den. When a feller gets married a good many years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>mit his wife, he gets very much attached to her. But if Mrs. Van
Winkle was a-drownin' in the water now, und should say to me,
"Rip, come und save your wife!" I would say, "Mrs. Van Winkle,
I will yust go home und tink about it!" Oh, no, Derrick, if ever
Gretchen tumbles in the water now, she's got to swim; I told you
dat&mdash;ha, ha, ha, ha! Hullo! dat's her a-comin' now; I guess it's
better I go oud!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene II</span>: <i>Rip's home. Shortly after his conversation with
Von Beekman, Rip's wife found him carousing and dancing upon
the village green with the pretty girls. She drove him away in
no very gentle fashion. Returning home after nightfall in a decidedly
muddled condition, he puts his head through the open window
at the rear, not observing his irate wife, who stands in ambush
behind the clothes-press, with her ever-ready broomstick, to
give him a warm reception; but seeing only his little daughter
Meenie, of whom he is very fond, Rip says</i>:</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Meenie! Meenie, my darlin'!</p>

<p><i>Meenie.</i> Hush-sh-h. (<i>Shakes finger to indicate the presence of
her mother.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Eh! what's the matter? I don't see nothing, my darlin'.
Meenie, is the old wildcat home? Oh, say, is dot you, Gretchen?
My darlin', my angel, don't do dat,&mdash;let go my head, won't you?
Well, den, hold on to it so long what you like. For what you do
dat, eh? You must want a bald-headed husband, I reckon.</p>

<p><i>Gretchen.</i> Who was that you called a wildcat?</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Who was dat I call a wildcat? Well, now, let me see,
who was dat I called a wildcat? Dat must have been the time I
came in the window dere, wasn't it? Yes, I know, it was the same
time. Well, now, let me see. (<i>Suddenly.</i>) It was de dog
Schneider dat I call it.</p>

<p><i>Gretchen.</i> The dog Schneider? That's a likely story.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Of course it is likely,&mdash;he's my dog. I'll call him a wildcat
much as I please. (<i>Gretchen begins to weep.</i>) Oh, well; dere,
now, don't you cry, don't you cry, Gretchen; you hear what I
said? Listen now. If you don't cry, I nefer drink anoder drop
of liquor in my life.</p>

<p><i>Gretchen.</i> O Rip, you have said so so many, many times, and
you never kept your word yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Well, I say it dis time, und I mean it.</p>

<p><i>Gretchen.</i> O Rip! if I could only trust you.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> You mustn't <i>suspect</i> me. Can't you see repentance in my
eye?</p>

<p><i>Gretchen.</i> Rip, if you will only keep your word, I shall be the
happiest woman in the world.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> You can believe it. I nefer drink anoder drop so long
what I live, if you don't cry.</p>

<p><i>Gretchen.</i> O Rip, how happy we shall be! And you'll get
back all the village, Rip, just as you used to have it; and you'll
fix up our little house so nicely; and you and I, and our darling
little Meenie here&mdash;how happy we shall be!</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Dere, dere, now! you can be just so happy what you like.
Go in de odder room, go along mit you; I come in dere pooty
quick. (<i>Exit Gretchen and Meenie.</i>) My! I swore off from drinking
so many, many times, und I never kept my word yet. (<i>Taking
out bottle.</i>) I don't believe dere is more as one good drink in dat
bottle, anyway. It's a pity to waste it! You goin' to drink dat?
Well, now, if you do, it is de last one, remember dat, old feller.
Well, here is your good health, und&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>FATHER'S WAY<br />
BY EUGENE FIELD</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">My father was no pessimist; he loved the things of earth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Its cheerfulness and sunshine, its music and its mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He never sighed or moped around whenever things went wrong,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I warrant me he'd mocked at fate with some defiant song;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But, being he warn't much on tune, when times looked sort o' blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He'd whistle softly to himself this only tune he knew,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Now mother, when she heard that tune which father whistled so,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Would say, "There's something wrong to-day with Ephraim, I know;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He never tries to make believe he's happy that 'ere way<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But that I'm certain as can be there's somethin' wrong to pay."<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And so betimes, quite natural-like, to us observant youth<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There seemed suggestion in that tune of deep, pathetic truth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">When Brother William joined the war, a lot of us went down<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To see the gallant soldier boys right gayly out of town.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A-comin' home, poor mother cried as if her heart would break,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And all us children, too,&mdash;for <i>hers</i>, and <i>not</i> for <i>William's</i> sake!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But father, trudgin' on ahead, his hands behind him so,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Kept whistlin' to himself, so sort of solemn-like and low.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">And when my oldest sister, Sue, was married and went West,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Seemed like it took the tuck right out of mother and the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She was the sunlight in our home,&mdash;why, father used to say<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It wouldn't seem like home at all if Sue should go away;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But when she went, a-leavin' us all sorrer and all tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Poor father whistled lonesome-like&mdash;and went to feed the steers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">When crops were bad, and other ills befell our homely lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He'd set of nights and try to act as if he minded not;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And when came death and bore away the one he worshiped so,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span><span class="i3">How vainly did his lips belie the heart benumbed with wo!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You see the telltale whistle told a mood he'd not admit,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He'd always stopt his whistlin' when he thought we noticed it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">I'd like to see that stooping form and hoary head again,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To see the honest, hearty smile that cheered his fellow men.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Oh, could I kiss the kindly lips that spake no creature wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And share the rapture of the heart that overflowed with song!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Oh, could I hear the little tune he whistled long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When he did battle with the griefs he would not have <i>us</i> know!<br /></span>

<h3>VIRGINIUS<br />
BY MACAULAY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Straightway Virginius led the maid a little space aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To where the reeking shambles stood, piled up with horn and hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Hard by, a butcher on a block had laid his whittle down,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Virginius caught the whittle up, and hid it in his gown.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And then his eyes grew very dim, and his throat began to swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And in a hoarse, changed voice he spake, "Farewell, sweet child, farewell!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The house that was the happiest within the Roman walls,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The house that envied not the wealth of Capua's marble halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Now, for the brightness of thy smile, must have eternal gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And for the music of thy voice, the silence of the tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"The time is come. The tyrant points his eager hand this way;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">See how his eyes gloat on thy grief, like a kite's upon the prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With all his wit he little deems that spurned, betrayed, bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thy father hath, in his despair, one fearful refuge left:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He little deems that, in my hand, I clutch what still can save<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thy gentle youth from taunts and blows, the portion of the slave;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Yea, and from nameless evil, that passeth taunt and blow,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Foul outrage, which thou knowest not,&mdash;which thou shalt never know.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then clasp me round the neck once more, and give me one more kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And now, mine own dear little girl, there is no way but this!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With that he lifted high the steel, and smote her in the side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And in her blood she sank to earth, and with one sob she died.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then, for a little moment, all the people held their breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And through the crowded forum was stillness as of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And in another moment broke forth from one and all<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A cry as if the Volscians were coming o'er the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Till, with white lips and bloodshot eyes, Virginius tottered nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And stood before the judgment seat, and held the knife on high:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"O dwellers in the nether gloom, avengers of the slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By this dear blood I cry to you, do right between us twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And e'en as Appius Claudius has dealt by me and mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Deal you by Appius Claudius and all the Claudian line!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So spake the slayer of his child; then where the body lay,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span><span class="i3">Pausing, he cast one haggard glance, and turned and went his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then up sprang Appius Claudius: "Stop him, alive or dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Ten pounds of copper to the man who brings his head!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He looked upon his clients, but none would work his will;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He looked upon his lictors, but they trembled and stood still.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And as Virginius through the press his way in silence cleft,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Ever the mighty multitude fell back to right and left;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And he hath passed in safety unto his woful home,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And there ta'en horse, to tell the camp what deeds are done in Rome.<br /></span>

<h3>THE WOMEN OF MUMBLES HEAD<br />
BY CLEMENT SCOTT</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Bring, novelist, your note-book! bring, dramatist, your pen!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I'll tell you a simple story of what women do for men.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It's only a tale of a life-boat, of the dying and the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of the terrible storm and shipwreck that happened off Mumbles Head!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Maybe you have traveled in Wales, sir, and know it north and south;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Maybe you are friends with the "natives" that dwell at Oyster-mouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It happens, no doubt, that from Bristol you've crossed in a casual way,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And have sailed your yacht in the summer in the blue of Swansea Bay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Well! it isn't like that in the winter, when the lighthouse stands alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In the teeth of Atlantic breakers that foam on its face of stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It wasn't like that when the hurricane blew, and the storm-bell tolled, or when<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There was news of a wreck, and the lifeboat launched, and a desperate cry for men.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When in the world did the coxswain shirk? a brave old salt was he!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Proud to the bone of as four strong lads as ever had tasted the<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></span>
<span class="i6">sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Welshmen all to the lungs and loins, who, about that coast, 'twas said,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Had saved some hundred lives apiece&mdash;at a shilling or so a head!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">So the father launched the life-boat, in the teeth of the tempest's roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And he stood like a man at the rudder, with an eye on his boys at the oar.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Out to the wreck went the father! out to the wreck went the sons!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Leaving the weeping women, and booming of signal guns;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Leaving the mother who loved them, and the girls that the sailors love;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Going to death for duty, and trusting to God above!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Do you murmur a prayer, my brothers, when cozy and safe in bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For men like these, who are ready to die for a wreck off Mumbles Head?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">It didn't go well with the life-boat! 'twas a terrible storm that blew!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And it snapped the rope in a second that was flung to the drowning crew;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And then the anchor parted&mdash;'twas a tussle to keep afloat!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But the father stuck to the rudder, and the boys to the brave old boat.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then at last on the poor doomed life-boat a wave broke mountains high!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"God help us now!" said the father. "It's over, my lads! Good-by!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Half of the crew swam shoreward, half to the sheltered caves,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But the father and sons were fighting death in the foam of the angry waves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Up at the lighthouse window two women beheld the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And saw in the boiling breakers a figure,&mdash;a fighting form;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It might be a gray-haired father, then the women held their breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It might be a fair-haired brother, who was having a round with death;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It might be a lover, a husband, whose kisses were on the lips<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span><span class="i3">Of the women whose love is the life of men going down to the sea in ships.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They had seen the launch of the life-boat, they had seen the worst, and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then, kissing each other, these women went down from the lighthouse, straight to shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">There by the rocks on the breakers these sisters, hand in hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">But what are a couple of women with only a man to save?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">What are a couple of women? well, more than three craven men<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Who stood by the shore with chattering teeth, refusing to stir&mdash;and then<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Off went the women's shawls, sir; in a second they're torn and rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then knotting them into a rope of love, straight into the sea they went!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Come back!" cried the lighthouse-keeper. "For God's sake, girls, come back!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As they caught the waves on their foreheads, resisting the fierce attack.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Come back!" moaned the gray-haired mother, as she stood by the angry sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"If the waves take you, my darlings, there's nobody left to me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Come back!" said the three strong soldiers, who still stood faint and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"You will drown if you face the breakers! you will fall if you brave the gale!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"<i>Come back?</i>" said the girls, "we will not! go tell it to all the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">We'll lose our lives, God willing, before that man shall drown!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Give one more knot to the shawls, Bess! give one strong clutch of your hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Just follow me, brave, to the shingle, and we'll bring him safe<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></span><span class="i6">to land!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Wait for the next wave, darling! only a minute more,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I'll have him safe in my arms, dear, and we'll drag him to the shore."<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Up to the arms in the water, fighting it breast to breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They caught and saved a brother alive. God bless them! you know the rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Well, many a heart beat stronger, and many a tear was shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And many a glass was tossed right off to "The Women of Mumbles Head!"<br /></span>

<span class="i3">The mellay of horns, and hoofs, and heads<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That wars, and wrangles, and scatters, and spreads;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The green beneath and the blue above,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And dash and danger and life and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And Lasca! Lasca used to ride<br /></span>

<span class="i3">With blue <i>serape</i> and bright-belled spur;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I laughed with joy as I looked at her!<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Little she cared, save to be by my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To ride with me, and ever to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From San Saba's shore to Lavaca's tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She was as bold as the billows that beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She was as wild as the breezes that blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From her little head to her little feet<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She was swayed, in her suppleness, to and fro<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By each gust of passion; a sapling pine,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">An inch to the left or an inch to the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I shouldn't be maundering here to-night;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound<br /></span>

<h3>OLD DADDY TURNER<br />

<p>This was the picture in front of "Old Daddy Turner's" cabin
in the Kaintuck quarter the other afternoon: Two colored men
sitting on a wash-bench, silent and sorrowful; an old dog, sleeping
in the sun at their feet, and a colored woman calling to a boy
who was on the fence: "Now, Jeems Henry, you git right down
from dat! Doan you know day Daddy Turner am jist on de
p'int of dyin' and gwine up to hebben?"</p>

<p>Here was the picture inside: The poor old, white-headed man
lying on his dying bed, flesh wasted away and strength departed.
Near him sat his faithful old wife, rocking to and fro and moaning
and grieving. Farther away was a colored man and woman,
solemn-faced and sad-hearted, shaking their heads as they cast
glances toward the bed. For a long time the old man lay quiet
and speechless, but at length he signed to be propped up. A
sun as warm as springtime poured into the room. He took notice
of it, and a change came to his face as his eyes rested upon his
grieving wife.</p>

<p>"Ize bin gwine back in my mind!" he whispered, as he reached
out his thin hand for her to clasp. "Fur ober fo'ty y'ars we's
trabbled 'long the same path. We sung de same songs&mdash;we prayed

leadin' down to de shor' of a big broad ribber. Ize seen people
gwine down dar to cross ober, an' in a leetle time I'll be wid 'em."</p>

<p>She put her wrinkled face on the pillow beside his and sobbed,
and he placed his hand on her head and said:</p>

<p>"It's de Lawd, chile&mdash;de bressed Lawd! Chile, Ize tried to
be good to yer. You has been good to me. We am nuffin but

<h3>THE DANDY FIFTH<br />
BY F. H. GASSAWAY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">'Twas the time of the workingmen's great strike, when all the land stood still<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At the sudden roar from the hungry mouths that labor could not fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When the thunder of the railroad ceased, and startled towns could spy<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A hundred blazing factories painting each midnight sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Through Philadelphia's surging streets marched the brown ranks of toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The grimy legions of the shops, the tillers of the soil.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">White-faced militiamen looked on, while women shrank with dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">'Twas muscle against money then, 'twas riches against bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Once, as the mighty mob tramped on, a carriage stopt the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Upon the silken seat of which a young patrician lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And as, with haughty glance, he swept along the jeering crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A white-haired blacksmith in the ranks took off his cap and bowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That night the Labor League was met, and soon the chairman said,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"There hides a Judas in our midst, one man who bows the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Who bends the coward's servile knee when capital rolls by."<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Down with him!" "Kill the traitor cur!" rang out the savage cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Up rose the blacksmith, then, and held erect his head of gray:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"I am no traitor, tho I bowed to a rich man's son to-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And, tho you kill me as I stand, as like you mean to do,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I want to tell you a story short, and I ask you'll hear me through.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I was one of those who enlisted first, the old flag to defend;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With Pope and Halleck, with 'Mac' and Grant, I followed to the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">'Twas somewhere down on the Rapidan, when the Union cause looked drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That a regiment of rich young bloods came down to us from here.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Their uniforms were by tailors cut; they brought hampers of good wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And every squad had a servant, too, to keep their boots in shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They'd naught to say to us dusty 'vets,' and, through the whole brigade<br /></span>
<span class="i3">We called them the kid-gloved Dandy Fifth, when we passed them on parade.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></span><span class="i3">Well, they were sent to hold a fort that Rebs tried hard to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">'Twas the key of all our line, which naught while it held out could break.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But a fearful fight we lost just then, the reserve came up too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And on that fort, and the Dandy Fifth, hung the whole division's fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Three times we tried to take them aid, and each time back we fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Tho once we could hear the fort's far guns boom like a funeral knell;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Till at length Joe Hooker's corps came up, and then straight through we broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">How we cheered as we saw those dandy coats still back of the drifting smoke!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With bands all front and our colors spread we swarmed up the parapet,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But the sight that silenced our welcome shout I shall never in life forget.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Four days before had their water gone,&mdash;they had dreaded that the most,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The next, their last scant ration went, and each man looked a ghost<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As he stood gaunt-eyed, behind his gun, like a crippled stag at bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And watched starvation, not defeat, draw nearer every day.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of all the Fifth, not fourscore men could in their places stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And their white lips told a fearful tale, as we grasped each bloodless hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The rest in the stupor of famine lay, save here and there a few<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In death sat rigid against the guns, grim sentinels in blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And their colonel could not speak or stir, but we saw his proud eye thrill<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span><span class="i3">As he simply glanced to the shot-scarred staff where the old flag floated still!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Now, I hate the tyrants who grind us down, while the wolf snarls at our door,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the men who've risen from us, to laugh at the misery of the poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But I tell you, mates, while this weak old hand I have left the strength to lift,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I will touch my cap to the proudest swell who fought in the Dandy Fifth!"<br /></span>

<h3>THE LITTLE STOWAWAY<br />
ANONYMOUS</h3>

<p>"'Bout three years ago, afore I got this berth as I'm in now,
I was second engineer aboard a Liverpool steamer bound for New
York. There'd been a lot of extra cargo sent down just at the last
minute, and we'd no end of a job stowin' it away, and that ran
us late o' startin'; so that, altogether, you may think, the cap'n
warn't in the sweetest temper in the world, nor the mate neither.
On the mornin' of the third day out from Liverpool, the chief
engineer cum down to me in a precious hurry, and says he: 'Tom,
what d'ye think? Blest if we ain't found a stowaway!'</p>

<p>"I didn't wait to hear no more, but up on deck like a sky-rocket;
and there I did see a sight, and no mistake. Every man-Jack
o' the crew, and what few passengers we had aboard, was
all in a ring on the fo'c'stle, and in the middle was the fust mate,
lookin' as black as thunder. Right in front of him, lookin' a
reg'lar mite among them big fellers, was a little bit o' a lad not
ten year old&mdash;ragged as a scarecrow, but with bright, curly hair,
and a bonnie little face o' his own, if it hadn't been so woful
and pale. The mate was a great, hulkin', black-bearded feller
with a look that 'ud ha' frightened a horse, and a voice fit to
make one jump through a keyhole; but the young un warn't a
bit afeard&mdash;he stood straight up, and looked him full in the face
with them bright, clear eyes o' his'n, for all the world as if he
was Prince Halferd himself. You might ha' heerd a pin drop,
as the mate spoke.</p>

<p>"'Well, you young whelp,' says he, 'what's brought you here?'</p>

<p>"'It was my stepfather as done it,' says the boy, in a weak
little voice, but as steady as he could be. 'Father's dead, and
mother's married again, and my new father says as how he won't
have no brats about eatin' up his wages; and he stowed me away
when nobody warn't lookin', and guv me some grub to keep me
going' for a day or two till I got to sea. He says I'm to go to
Aunt Jane, at Halifax; and here's her address.'</p>

<p>"We all believed every word on't, even without the paper he
held out. But the mate says: 'Look here, my lad; that's all very
fine, but it won't do here&mdash;some o' these men o' mine are in the
secret, and I mean to have it out of 'em. Now, you just point
out <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span>the man as stowed you away and fed you, this very minute;
if you don't, it'll be worse for you!'</p>

<p>"The boy looked up in his bright, fearless way (it did my
heart good to look at him, the brave little chap!) and says,
quietly, 'I've told you the truth; I ain't got no more to say.'</p>

<p>"The mate says nothin', but looks at him for a minute as if
he'd see clean through him; and then he sings out to the crew
loud enough to raise the dead: 'Reeve a rope to the yard; smart
now!'</p>

<p>"'Now, my lad, you see that 'ere rope? Well, I'll give you ten
minutes to confess; and if you don't tell the truth afore the
time's up, I'll hang you like a dog!'</p>

<p>"The crew all stared at one another as if they couldn't believe
their ears (I didn't believe mine, I can tell ye), and then a low
growl went among 'em, like a wild beast awakin' out of a nap.</p>

<p>"'Silence there!' shouts the mate, in a voice like the roar of a
nor'easter. 'Stan' by to run for'ard!' as he held the noose ready
to put it round the boy's neck. The little fellow never flinched
a bit; but there was some among the sailors (big strong chaps as
could ha' felled an ox) as shook like leaves in the wind. I
clutched hold o' a handspike, and held it behind my back, all
ready.</p>

<p>"'Tom,' whispers the chief engineer to me, 'd'ye think he
really means to do it?'</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' says I, through my teeth; 'but if he does, he
shall go first, if I swings for it!'</p>

<p>"I've been in many an ugly scrape in my time, but I never
felt 'arf as bad as I did then. Every minute seemed as long as a
dozen; and the tick o' the mate's watch, reg'lar, pricked my ears
like a pin.</p>

<p>"'Eight minutes,' says the mate, his great, deep voice breakin'
in upon the silence like the toll o' a funeral bell. 'If you've
got anything to confess, my lad, you'd best out with it, for ye're
time's nearly up.'</p>

<p>"'I've told you the truth,' answers the boy, very pale, but as
firm as ever. 'May I say my prayers, please?'</p>

<p>"The mate nodded; and down goes the poor little chap on his
knees and put up his poor little hands to pray. I couldn't
make out what he said, but I'll be bound God heard every word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></span>.
Then he ups on his feet again, and puts his hands behind him,
and says to the mate quite quietly: 'I'm ready.'</p>

<p>"And then, sir, the mate's hard, grim face broke up all to once,
like I've seed the ice in the Baltic. He snatched up the boy in
his arms, kissed him, and burst out a-cryin' like a child; and I
think there warn't one of us as didn't do the same. I know I did
for one.</p>

<p>"'God bless you, my boy!' says he, smoothin' the child's hair
with his great hard hand. 'You're a true Englishman, every inch
of you; you wouldn't tell a lie to save yer life! Well, if so be as
yer father's cast yer off, I'll be yer father from this day forth;
and if I ever forget you, then may God forget me!'</p>

<p>"And he kep' his word, too. When we got to Halifax, he
found out the little un's aunt, and gev' her a lump o' money to
make him comfortable; and now he goes to see the youngster
every voyage, as reg'lar as can be; and to see the pair on 'em
together&mdash;the little chap so fond of him, and not bearin' him
a bit o' grudge&mdash;it's 'bout as pretty a sight as ever I seed. And
now, sir, yer parding, it's time for me to be goin' below; so I'll
just wish yer good-night."</p>

<h3>THE C'RRECT CARD<br />
BY GEORGE R. SIMS</h3>

<p>"C'rrect card, sir? C'rrect card, sir? What! you've seen my
face before? Well I dare say as how you have, sir, and so have
many more; but they passes me by without a word&mdash;but perhaps
it's just as well; a poor crippled chap like me, sir, ain't fit
company for a swell. But I've seen the time when they all was
proud with me to be talking seen&mdash;when I rode for Lord Arthur
Forester, and wore the black and green. How did it happen? I'll
tell you, sir. You knew little Fanny Flight&mdash;old Farmer Flight's
one daughter&mdash;always so pretty and bright? You used to joke
with her sometimes, sir, and say as, if you she'd marry, you'd
set up a 'pub' together, an' pitch your folks to Old Harry. You
was just down for the holidays, sir, from Oxford, where you
were at school; but <i>you</i> only played at being in love, while I
... was a cursed fool! Well, there were lots of 'm after
her, sir, what with her ways and face; but I was in earnest, you
see, sir, and rode a waiting race. 'Twas one fine April morning,
when she came out to see us train, and just as she stood with her
little hand holding on by my horse's mane, I felt as how I could
do it, and came with a rush, you see, an' I said to her&mdash;all of a
tremble, sir,&mdash;'Fan, will you marry me?' And she blushed an'
smiled, an' whinnied, and after a bit she agreed that as soon as
I found the money to pay for our keep and feed, why we'd run
in harness together. We'd ha' made a tidyish pair; for I weren't
a bad looking colt at the time, and <i>she</i>&mdash;such a nice little mare!
Such a mouth! such a forehead! such action! Ah, well, let 'em
say what they may, that's the sort to make running with us, sir,&mdash;tho,
hang it! they never can <i>stay</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, the time went on, and I rode my best, an' they called me
a 'cuteish' chap, and Lord Arthur put me up to ride for the
Leicestershire Handicap. Lord Arthur, he was a <i>gentleman</i>&mdash;never
was stingy or mean&mdash;an' he said, 'I'll give you five hundred,
my man, if you win with the black and green.' Well, the horse I
rode was Rasper; perhaps you remember him?&mdash;Black all but
one white foot, sir; <i>and</i> a temper!&mdash;he'd pull like sin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a></span> But jump
like a bird if he had a mind&mdash;plenty of power and pace&mdash;and I
knew he had it in him, and I swore I'd win the race. The night
before the race came off I went down to Farmer Flight's&mdash;they'd
got to expect me regular now on Tuesday and Friday nights&mdash;and
I told her what Lord Arthur said, and how, if I chanced to
win, we'd go into double harness on the strength of his lordship's
tin. An' she put my colors in her hair, and her arms around my
neck, and I felt ... but, hang it! a chap's a fool as
can't keep his feelings in check. But then, you sees, sir, I <i>was</i>
a fool&mdash;a big one as ever was seen&mdash;but then I was only twenty
when I rode in the black and green. I got up early next morning,
an' felt as light as a feather, and I went to start for the
stables; and mother she asked me whether I'd not take my flask
in my pocket, in case it might come in handy; but 'Mother,' I
says, 'when a chap's in love, he don't feel to want any brandy.'
And I thought, as I put on a new pair o' spurs, and a jacket
bran new and clean, that I'd give long odds that I'd pull it off&mdash;ten
to one on the black and green. Well, Lord Arthur gave
me my orders, and a leg up on to my horse, and I just had taken
my canter an' was coming back up the course, when who should
I spy but Fanny, in a stylish sort of a trap, talking away like
blazes to a dark, long-whiskered chap; but I hadn't time to think
of more, for we got the word to start, and Rasper gave a thundering
tear that nearly pulled out my heart; an' then I pulled him
together, for mine was a waiting race, and I knew that what was to
win it was Rasper's pluck not pace. Well, I got round all right
the first time; the fences were easy enough&mdash;at least to a couple
like <i>we</i> were; the only one that was tough was a biggish hedge,
with a post and rails; but the taking-off was fair, and I shouldn't
call it a dangerous jump, as long as you took it with care. And
Rasper! that very morning I said to Lord Arthur, I said, 'I think
as that horse there could jump a <i>church</i>, if he took the thing
into his head'; an' that morning he went like a lady and looked as
bright as a bean, and I knew, if it only lasted, I'd win with the
black and green. I was riding Rasper easy, when, just as we
passed the stand, it struck me the carriage that Fanny was in
was somewhere upon my right hand; and I took a pull at Rasper,
and a glance toward that side, and I saw what made me forget
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></span>race and forget the way to ride&mdash;only a kiss! An' what's a
kiss to the like of him and her? But I could not help letting
Rasper feel that I wore a long-necked spur; an' tho I set my
teeth to be cool and steadied him with the rein, I knew that the
devil in Rasper was up, and couldn't be laid again; an' the very
next fence, tho I kept him straight, and he went at it after the
rest, I could feel that he meant to do his worst, and I couldn't ride
my best. For, you know, when a man feels desperate-like, he's
no more head than a child, and it's all <i>up</i> with a jock, you see, if
he goes at his fences wild. Over the next fence&mdash;over the
next&mdash;till I thought, as my teeth I set, if I only could keep my head to
my work, I might pull through with it yet; and I took a pull at
Rasper, an' fell back a bit to the tail, for I'd never forget the
one difficult spot&mdash;the hedge with the post and rail. How it all
comes back! We're in the field&mdash;now for a rattling burst; for
the race is half won by the horse and man that crosses that fence
first. I run up to my horses and pass them&mdash;I've given Rasper
his head; I can hear, some lengths behind me, the trampling and
the tread; and now I send him at it firmly but not too fast&mdash;he
stops&mdash;lays his ears back&mdash;REFUSES! <i>The devil's come out
at last!</i> And I dig in the steel and let him feel the sting of stout
whalebone, and I say, 'You shall do it, you devil! if I break
your neck and my own.' And the brute gives a squeal, and rushes
at the post and rail like mad&mdash;no time to rise him at it&mdash;not
much use if I had; and then ... well, I feel a crash and a blow,
and hear a woman scream, and I seem to be dying by inches in a
horrid sort of a dream.</p>

<p>"No, thank ye&mdash;I'd rather not, sir. You see they ain't all
like you; these gents as has plenty of money don't care who they
gives it to; but as for stopping an' saying a word, an' hearing
a fellow's tale, they'd rather give him a crown, sir, or stand him
a quart of ale. But it brings back old times to be talking to you.
Ah! the jolly old times as I've seen, when I rode for Lord Arthur
(c'rrect card, sir?) and wore the black and green!"</p>

<h3>THE FACE UPON THE FLOOR<br />
BY H. ANTOINE D'ARCY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">'Twas a balmy summer evening, and a goodly crowd was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Which well-nigh filled Joe's barroom on the corner of the square;<br /></span>

<span class="i3">A vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon the floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">And but for a blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">With eyes that petrified my brain, and sunk into my heart.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">"Why don't you laugh? 'Tis funny that the vagabond you see<br /></span>

<span class="i3">"That's why I took to drink, boys. Why I never saw you smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I thought you'd be amused, and laughing all the while.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Why, what's the matter, friend? There's a tear-drop in your eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Come, laugh like me; 'tis only babes and women that cry.<br /></span>

<h3>THE FUNERAL OF THE FLOWERS<br />
BY T. DE WITT TALMAGE</h3>

<p>The summer is ended, and we have all been invited to attend
the Funeral of the Flowers. It occurred on a long slope which at
one side dipt into the warm valleys, and on the other side arose
very high into the frosty air, so that on one boundary line lived
cactus and orange-blossom and camellia, and on the other resided
balsam-pine and Alpine strawberry, and all kinds of growths
between.</p>

<p>Living midway that steep slope of land there was a rose, that
in common parlance we called "Giant of Battle." It was red and
fiery, looking as if it had stood on fields of carnage where the
blood dashed to the lip. It was a hero among flowers. Many of
the grasses of the field worshiped it as a god, the mignonette
burning incense beneath it, the marigold throwing glittering rays
of beauty before it, the mistletoe crawling at its feet. The fame
of this Giant of Battle was world-wide, and some said that its
ancestors on the father's side had stood on the plains of Waterloo,
and on its mother's side at Magneta, and drank themselves drunk
on human gore. But children are not to blame for what their
ancestors do, and this rose, called Giant of Battle, was universally
adored.</p>

<p>But the Giant got sick. Whether it was from the poisonous
breath of the Nightshade that had insolently kissed him, or from
grief at the loss of a Damask-rose that had first won his heart
by her blushes, and then died, we know not; but the Giant of Battle
was passing rapidly away. There was great excitement up
and down the slopes. A consultation of botanical physicians was
called, and Doctor Eglantine came and thrust a thorn for a lancet
into the Giant's veins, on the principle that he had too much
blood and was apoplectic, and Doctor Balm of Gilead attempted
to heal the pain by poultices; but still the Giant grew worse and
worse. The Primrose called in the evening to see how the dying
hero was, and the Morning-glory stopt before breakfast to see
if it could do any good. Every flower or grass that called
had a prescription for him that would surely cure. Neighbor
Horse-sorrel suggested acids, and Honeysuckle proposed sugars,
and Myrrh suggested bitters, and Ladies'-slipper, having taken
off her shoes, said all the patient wanted was more quiet about
the room.</p>

<p>But too much changing of medicine only made the Giant more
and more sick, and one afternoon, while sitting up in bed with
a cup of honeysuckle to his lips, and with the fan of the south
wind fluttering in his face, his head dropt and he died. As the
breath went out of him a Clematis that had been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a></span>overlooking the
sad scene, said: "What time is it?" and a cluster of Four-o'clocks
answered, "A little past the middle of the afternoon."</p>

<p>The next morning the funeral bells all rang: the Blue-bells
and the Canterbury-bells and the Fox-glove-bells and Hare-bells
and all the flowerdom came to the obsequies of the Giant of
Battle. He was laid out on a trellis, and on a catafalque, such
as dead monarchs never had, of dahlia and phlox and magnolia
and geranium and gladiola. There was a great audience of flowers.
Solemnity came down upon them. Even the Cock's-comb
stopt strutting, and Larkspur ceased her fickleness, and Snapdragon
looked gentle, and Snowdrop seemed to melt, and Bachelor's-button
wished it had some one to express its grief to. The
Passion-flower came in and threw herself on the pale cheek of
the Giant with most ardent demonstration of affection. Amaranth
and Hydrangea and Daffodil and Spiderwort and Spiræa having
come far from the night and dew, stood around with their eyes
full of tears.</p>

<p>The funeral services began. Rose of Sharon and Lily of the
Valley took part in them. The Star of Bethlehem sang a hymn
to the tune of Bonny Doon. Forget-me-not said a few words
of commemoration. Then Heartsease arose for the work of comfort,
and read the lesson of the day: "As a flower of the field,
so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
and the place thereof shall know it no more." And all the bells,
Fox-glove-bells and Blue-bells and Canterbury-bells and Hare-bells,
prolonged the strain through all that day, tolling, tolling out,
"No more! no more!"</p>

<span class="i3">Alas! our dreams, they come not true.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">But bitter frosts would fall at night, and on the grapes that withered blight,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I could not go to Carcassonne,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I never went to Carcassonne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">They say it is as gay all times as holidays at home.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The gentles ride in gay attire, and in the sun each gilded spire<br /></span>

<span class="i3">The bishop the procession leads, the generals curb their prancing steeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Alas! I saw not Carcassonne.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Alas! I know not Carcassonne.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Our vicar's right. He preaches loud and bids us to beware.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He says, "Oh, guard the weakest part and most the traitor in the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Against ambition's snare."<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Perhaps in autumn I can find two sunny days with gentle wind,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">My wife, my son have seen Narbonne, my grandson went to Perpignan,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">The hands of those brothers played strain on strain,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">They are drawn so tight they will snap asunder<br /></span>
<span class="i5">I thought, but instead they grew<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In the hands of the Master, firmer and stronger,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And I could hear on the stilly air;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Now my ears were deafened by mirth no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The sounds of sorrow, and grief and despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And my soul grew tender and kind to others;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">My nature grew sweeter and my mind grew broad<br /></span>

<span class="i3">The last red streaks had faded; night and rest<br /></span>

<span class="i3">The blazing bivouac fires on every hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And save the tramp of pickets all is still.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">How all its sparkling waves reflect the light<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And add new glories to the starlit night!<br /></span>

<span class="i3">From first in rank to little drummer-boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The loud huzzas and wildest cheers were given,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That seemed to cleave the air and reach to heaven.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Such sounds can startle them, but not dismay.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Alas! Those strains of music which of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Could rouse their hearts are felt by them no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When the last echo of the song had died<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And all was silent on the Northern side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There came from Southern hill, with gentle swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The air of "Dixe," which was loved so well<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By every man that wore the coat of gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And is revered and cherished to this day.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"In Dixie's Land" they swore to live and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That was their watchword, that their battle-cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then rose on high the wild Confederate yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Resounding over every hill and dell.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Cheer after cheer went up that starry night<br /></span>

<span class="i3">A shout tremendous; forgetting they were foes,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And by those martial strains a victory's won!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But there's one strain that friends and foes will win,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">The Marquis of Carabas.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">I hope that, to get to the kingdom of heaven,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">To my lady of Carabas.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Meanwhile I was thinking of my first love,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">As I had not been thinking of aught for years,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Till over my eyes there began to move<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Something that felt like tears.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">I thought of the dress that she wore last time,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">When we stood, 'neath the cypress-trees, together,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In that lost land, in that soft clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">In the crimson evening weather;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Of that muslin dress (for the eve was hot),<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And her warm, white neck in its golden chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And her full, soft hair, just tied in a knot,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And falling loose again;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">And the jasmine-flower in her fair, young breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Oh, the faint, sweet smell of that jasmine-flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the one bird singing alone to his nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And the one star over the tower.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">I thought of our little quarrels and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And the letter that brought me back my ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And it all seemed then, in the waste of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Such a very little thing!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">For I thought of her grave below the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Which the sentinel cypress-tree stands over.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I thought ... "were she only living still,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">How I could forgive her and love her."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">And I swear, as I thought thus, in that hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And of how, after all, old things were best,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That I smelt the smell of that jasmine-flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Which she used to wear in her breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">It smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">It made me creep, and it made me cold!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Like the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet<br /></span>
<span class="i5">When a mummy is half unrolled.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">And I turned and looked. She was sitting there<br /></span>
<span class="i5">In a dim box, over the stage; and drest<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In that muslin dress, with that full soft hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And that jasmine in her breast!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">I was here, and she was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And the glittering horseshoe curved between&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From my bride-betrothed, with her raven hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And her sumptuous, scornful mien.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">To my early love, with her eyes downcast,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And over her primrose face the shade<br /></span>

<span class="i5">There was but one step to be made.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">To my early love from my future bride<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">My thinking of her, or the music's strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Or something which never will be exprest,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">With the jasmine in her breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">She is not dead, and she is not wed!<br /></span>
<span class="i5">But she loves me now, and she loved me then!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the very first word that her sweet lips said,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">My heart grew youthful again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">The marchioness there, of Carabas,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">She is wealthy, and young, and handsome still,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And but for her ... well, we'll let that pass&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">She may marry whomever she will.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">But I will marry my own first love,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">With her primrose face; for old things are best,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">The brooch in my lady's breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">The world is filled with folly and sin,<br /></span>

<p>"His book&mdash;like American conversation&mdash;is made
up of anecdotes. He talks intimately of Richard

Joseph Jefferson, Senator Depew, Henry Watterson,
Gen. Horace Porter, Augustin Daly, Henry
Irving, Buffalo Bill, King Edward VII., Mrs.
Langtry, and a host of other personages, large and

apace." You'll find laughs bubbling all
through this new book.</p>
